## Golem REPL

Once you have a component using `golem` commands,
you can spin up a REPL to interact with your functions.

Golem REPL is backed by the language [Rib](/rib)

For example, using the [quickstart example](/quickstart):

```shell
golem repl
```

```shell
>>> let a1 = counter-agent("agent-1")
()
>>> let a2 = counter-agent("another")
()
>>> a1.increment()
1
>>> a1.increment()
2
>>> a2.increment()
1
```

REPL is a great way to test the component and its functions,
however note that it's a brand new feature and is experimental in nature.
