## Golem REPL

Once you have a component using `golem app` commands,
you can spin up a REPL to interact with your functions.

Golem REPL is backed by the language [Rib](/rib)


```shell
cd shopping-cart
golem repl
```

```shell
>>> let worker = instance("worker")
()

>>> worker.add-item({product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42})
()

>>> worker.add-item({product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42})
()

>>> worker.get-cart-contents()
[{product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42}, {product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42}]

>>> worker.checkout()
success({order-id: "238738674"})
```

REPL is a great way to test the component and its functions,
however note that it's a brand new feature and is experimental in nature.
