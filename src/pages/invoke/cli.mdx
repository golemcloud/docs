# Invoke using Golem CLI

The `golem` command line interface exposes one invocation subcommand:

- `golem agent invoke` triggers a function invocation on an agent and awaits its result
- `golem agent invoke --enqueue` just enqueues an invocation and returns immediately

## Specifying what to invoke

The command requires specifying which agent to invoke, and the name of the function.

There are multiple options for selecting the agent:

- `agent-type(agent-parameters)`
- `component-name/agent-type(agent-parameters)`
- `project-name/component-name/agent-type(agent-parameters)`
- `account-name/project-name/component-name/agent-type(agent-parameters)`

Note that the `agent-type(agent-parameters)` part is also referred as the _agent ID_, or in previous versions, the _worker name_.

Also note that you can only omit the component name if it can be inferred from the context, for example if the current directory is a component directory or the application root with a single component only.

The function to be invoked is selected by the second parameter. Read the [invocation function name syntax page](/function-names) for more information about the possible function names.

## Encoding parameters

The CLI requires you to encode the function parameters using the [WebAssembly Value Encoding](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) with one or more parameters following the function name (one for each invocation parameter).

## Getting results

When using `invoke` without the `--enqueue` flag, the CLI awaits the result of the invocation and prints the result value to the standard output. By default it uses the `text` format, in which case it prints the result value using the [WebAssembly Value Encoding](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave).

This can be changed with `--format json` or `--format yaml` to print the invocation result in JSON or YAML, using the [mapping described on the JSON WAVE Mapping page](/json-wave-mapping).

## Logs

Both invocation commands accept an optional `--stream` flag for connecting to the invoked agent's event stream and showing its logs. This works the same as running a separate `golem agent stream` command during the invocation. The logs consists of everything the agent writes to its standard output and standard error, as well as through the logging API.

The `--stream` option's output (and also the `stream` subcommand) can be customized with the following parameters:

- `--format text|json|yaml` for different encodings of the log lines
- `--colors=yes|no` to enable/disable colors for the `text` format
- `--show-timestamps=yes|no` to enable/disable showing timestamps for each log line
- `--show-level=yes|no` to enable/disable showing the log level (or stdout/stderr) for each log line

## Cancelling pending invocations

As invocations are executed sequentially, it is possible to cancel a pending invocation before it starts executing. This can be done using the command line interface by running the `agent cancel-invocation` subcommand:

```shell copy
golem agent cancel-invocation <component-name>/<agent-id> --idempotency-key <idempotency-key>
```
