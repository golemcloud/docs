## Setting up CORS for the APIs

Setting up CORS for a resource (route) in API Gateway is done by specifying an extra route for the same `route`,
with `OPTIONS` method, and will serve the browser's preflight request.

By adding this route, all the routes with the same resource (route) ha will be automatically enabled with CORS.
In other words, all the operations under the resource will be enabled with CORS.


### Default CORS
Here is a complete example where `/v1/{user}/checkout` resource is CORS enabled.


```yaml
# Schema for IDEA:
# $schema: https://schema.golem.cloud/app/golem/1.2.2-dev.1/golem.schema.json
# Schema for vscode-yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.golem.cloud/app/golem/1.2.2-dev.1/golem.schema.json

components:
  amazon:shopping-cart:
    template: rust

httpApi:
  definitions:
    shopping-cart:
      version: '0.0.5'
      routes:
        - method: OPTIONS
          path: /v1/{user}/checkout
          binding:
            type: cors-preflight
        - method: POST
          path: /v1/{user}/add-to-cart
          binding:
            type: default
            componentName: "amazon:shopping-cart"
            response: |
              let user: u32 = request.path.user;
              let worker = instance("cart-${user}");
              worker.add-item(request.body);
              "successfully added item to the cart"
        - method: GET
          path: /v1/{user}/contents
          security: my-security
          binding:
            type: default
            componentName: "amazon:shopping-cart"
            response: |
              let user: u32 = request.path.user;
              let worker = instance("cart-${user}");
              let user-name: string = request.auth.email;
              {
                user: user-name,
                cart: worker.get-cart-contents()
              }
        - method: POST
          path: /v1/{user}/checkout
          binding:
            type: default
            componentName: "amazon:shopping-cart"
            response: |
              let user: u32 = request.path.user;
              let worker = instance("cart-${user}");
              worker.checkout()

  # Uncomment if you want to deploy your api

Here, we define the preflight request endpoint for `/v1/{user}/checkout` as the OPTIONS method.
This is used by browsers to check if the actual request is allowed.

```yaml
 - method: OPTIONS
   path: /v1/{user}/checkout
   binding:
     type: cors-preflight
```


As mentioned before, this additional route will ensure that the other operations (in the above example, GET)
will also be CORS-enabled with the required headers in the response.

You can simulate a preflight request and test this

```sh
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost:9006/v1/100/checkout \
                           -H "Origin: https://myfrontend.com" \
                           -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: PUT" \
                           -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization, Content-Type" \
                           -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
access-control-allow-origin: *
access-control-allow-methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS
access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization
access-control-expose-headers: Content-Length, X-Requested-With
access-control-allow-credentials: true
access-control-max-age: 86400
content-length: 0
date: Tue, 13 May 2025 23:55:01 GMT

```

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:9006/v1/100/checkout -H "origin: localhost"    Tue 13 May 17:55:01 2025
{"success":{"order-id":"238738674"}}‚èé
```

### Customised CORS
But we can customise this behaviour further by providing custom CORS set up by doing the following

```yaml
- method: OPTIONS
  path: /v1/{user}/checkout
  binding:
    type: cors-preflight
    response: |
     {
      Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*",
      Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS",
      Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Content-Type, Authorization",
      Access-Control-Expose-Headers: "Content-Length, X-Requested-With",
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true,
      Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400u64
     }
```

Here is the full example

We can define a custom response for the preflight request as well using Rib as given below.
Her we changed the origins to be `mysite.com` instead of `*`

```yaml
# Schema for IDEA:
# $schema: https://schema.golem.cloud/app/golem/1.2.2-dev.1/golem.schema.json
# Schema for vscode-yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.golem.cloud/app/golem/1.2.2-dev.1/golem.schema.json

```sh
golem api deploy

```

The allowed origin is only `mysite.com` as per the API definition, and if the origin is different it should result in "origin not allowed"

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:9006/v1/100/checkout -H "origin: notmysite.com"
CORS Error: Origin not allowed
```

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:9006/v1/100/checkout -H "origin: mysite.com"   Tue 13 May 17:59:13 2025
{"success":{"order-id":"238738674"}}
```
