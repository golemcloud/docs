## Deploy the API Definition

Using golem, deploying the API definition is straight forward.

```shell copy
golem api deployment deploy my-shopping-cart-v1/0.0.4 --host localhost:9006
```

The above command returns the following:

```json
{
  "apiDefinitions": [
    {
      "id": "my-shopping-cart-v1",
      "version": "0.0.4"
    }
  ],
  "site": {
    "host": "localhost:9006",
    "subdomain": null
  },
  "createdAt": "2024-10-31T07:36:47.497267721Z"
}
```

Here we deploy the definition and now the endpoints should be available at `host` `localhost:9006`. If you were following docker examples to spin up Golem, then the port has to be 9006.
Refer to `.env` in docker-examples folder in Golem OSS.

You can test the deployment now, by trying to call the endpoint defined in the API definition.
