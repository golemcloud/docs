## Expose HTTP APIs for your Golem App

The first step to exposing your the functions in your component (in short, worker functions) as http apis,
is to edit the manifest golem.yaml to add an API definition.

### Configure API definition and deployment
If you are following the shopping-cart [example](/invoke/making-custom-apis/create-simple-component),
then you already have a `golem.yaml` file in the `shopping-cart/components-rust/amazon-shopping-cart` directory.

Below given is an example of updated `golem.yaml` with a definition, consisting of multiple routes

The manifest also has API deployment details that specify the details of the server to which the requests should be routed.
Since this example is making using of golem OSS, the only valid value is `http://localhost:9006/v1`
because that's where the API gateway is running when you run the golem server.

```yaml
# Schema for IDEA:
# $schema: https://schema.golem.cloud/app/golem/1.2.2-dev.1/golem.schema.json
# Schema for vscode-yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://schema.golem.cloud/app/golem/1.2.2-dev.1/golem.schema.json

# See https://learn.golem.cloud/docs/app-manifest#field-reference for field reference

components:
  amazon:shopping-cart:
    template: rust

httpApi:
  definitions:
    shopping-cart:
      version: '0.0.1'
      routes:
        - method: POST
          path: /v1/{user}/add-to-cart
          binding:
            type: default
            componentName: "amazon:shopping-cart"
            response: |
              let user: u32 = request.path.user;
              let worker = instance("cart-${user}");
              worker.add-item(request.body);
             "successfully added item to cart"

  deployments:
    local:
    - host: localhost:9006
      definitions:
       - shopping-cart
```

### Deploy and Test the API

```shell
golem api deploy
```

### Test the API

```shell
curl -X POST http://localhost:9006/v1/100/add-to-cart -d '{"product-id": "foo", "name": "foo", "price": 42, "quantity": 42}' -H "Accept: application/json"
"successfully added item to the cart"
```

Please make sure to pass the content type header. While `application/json` will be automatically picked up many times,
in certain cases, it will work only if you explicitly specify. More on this later.

### More on Route parameters

Please use this as a reference instead of using it with zero changes. For example, you might need to give a different
version, component etc (explained below). You can get the `component` details including `name` and `version`
by running `golem component list` command.

The API definition's fields have the following meaning:

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `version` | This field indicates the version of the API definition. Here, it is set to "0.0.1".                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `routes`  | This field contains an array of route objects, each representing a specific endpoint definition.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `method`  | Indicates the HTTP method associated with the route. In this example, it is set to "Get", indicating that this route handles GET requests.                                                                                                                            |
| `path`    | Specifies the URL path pattern for the route. It may include path parameters enclosed in curly braces. Here, the path is `/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`, indicating that this route handles requests to retrieve the contents of a shopping cart for a specific user. |
| `binding` | This object contains information about how the request should be handled by the Golem worker. A typical Rib expression will create an `instance` of a worker, and then call a function on that instance with arguments. You can transform the input and output optionally using Rib itself, and the final result of this Rib script will be automatically mapped to a http response. Hence you don't need to write too many functions within the component to satisfy an ever changing http apis |                                                                                                                                                                    |

### More on Binding

Let's break down the binding object.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`        | Specifies the type of binding. Here, it is set to "default", indicating that the binding involves a Golem worker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `component`   | Specifies the component's name and version                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `response`    | The `response` field here is a Rib expression that allows you to call any worker function and manipulates its output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

See the [binding type reference](/http-api-definitions/api-definition-bindings) for more details on the supported binding types.

If your worker name is a constant, the you can simply make it a constant string such as `"foo"`. Please note that it has to be quoted for it a valid Rib string.
See the [Rib reference](/rib) for the full reference of the binding language.


### More on Rib script within a binding

```rib
let user: u32 = request.path.user;
let worker = instance("cart-${user}");
worker.add-item(request.body);
"successfully added item to cart"
```

* The first line is about extracting the user-id from the path and assigning it to the variable user. For an HTTP request such as `/v1/100/add-to-cart`, the value of user will be 100.
Note that user should be of type u32; otherwise, you will get a BadRequest error. This serves as an example of looking up the attributes of the HTTP request inside a Rib script.

    Note that you can also extract the query parameters (request.query.user), headers (request.headers.user), and body (request.body) from the request object.

    The `request` object is a record that contains all the information about the HTTP request.
    This object is automatically passed to the Rib script through gateway when an API is invoked.
    You can find more details about the `request` object in the [Rib documentation](/rib#http-request-input-and-field-selection),
    which covers how to look up the path, query, header and body parameters in a Http Request using Rib.

* The second line is about creating a worker instance with the name `cart-${user}`.
  This means that when this route is called with a user-id 1, it creates a corresponding worker with the name worker-1.

  Providing a name as an argument to the instance function means you are creating a durable worker.
Skipping this name would result in an ephemeral worker.

* The third line is about calling the function add-item in the component, and it will be invoked against the worker `cart-${user}`.

* Finally, the last line is a Rib expression that returns the string "successfully added item to cart" as the response body.

You need to specify the content type when invoking this route, since the final result is a primitive.
The content type defaults to application/json for any complex types.


### Ephemeral and Durable worker invocation

The worker can be ephemeral or durable depending on whether you passed the worker-name argument into the `instance` function.
You can find more details about the `instance` function in the [Rib reference](/rib).
