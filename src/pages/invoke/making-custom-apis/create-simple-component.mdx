### Create a new component

As the first step to creating APIs using API gateway, let's create a simple component.

We recommend trying out this simple example first before moving to exposing any complex worker
functions as http APIs

```shell
golem app new
```

Please follow the instructions in the interactive shell. Here is the example


```shell
Selected profile: local
> Application name: shopping-cart
> Select language for the new component Rust
> Select a template for the new component: minimal: Minimal component template for Rust with no dependencies
> Component Package Name: amazon:shopping-cart
> Add another component or create application? Create application
```

Make sure to start the golem server by doing the following.
Use `--clean` if you want a complete clean environment

```shell
golem server run --clean

```

Before we start building the API definition, make sure to replace the contents of
shopping-cart/components-rust/amazon-shopping-cart/wit/amazon-shopping-cart.wit with the following

```wit
package amazon:shopping-cart;

interface api {

  record product-item {
    product-id: string,
    name: string,
    price: f32,
    quantity: u32,
  }

  record order {
    order-id: string,
    items: list<product-item>,
    total: f32,
    timestamp: u64,
  }

  record order-confirmation {
    order-id: string,
  }

  variant checkout-result {
    error(string),
    success(order-confirmation),
  }

  initialize-cart: func(user-id: string);

  add-item: func(item: product-item);

  remove-item: func(product-id: string);

  update-item-quantity: func(product-id: string, quantity: u32);

  checkout: func() -> checkout-result;

  get-cart-contents: func() -> list<product-item>;

  force-commit: func(count: u8);
}

world shopping-cart {
  import golem:api/host@1.1.6;

  export api;
}
```

### Implement the interface

Try to build the component

```shell
cd shopping-cart
golem app build
```

This should give you a compile time error, and that's because you haven't implemented the interface yet.
The implementation details doesn't matter.


Once you fix the compilation errors, test the invocations using golem REPL

### Test the invocations
```shell
cd shopping-cart
golem repl
```

If by any chance you have multiple components in the context, interactive shell would allow you to select
a specific component and will be automatically deployed to the server.


Here is an example usage of REPL. Please take advantage of the auto-completes using `tab` key.

More documentation on the REPL can be found [here](/rib).

```shell
>>> let worker = instance("worker")
()

>>> worker.add-item({product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42})
()

>>> worker.add-item({product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42})
()

>>> worker.get-cart-contents()
[{product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42}, {product-id: "foo", name: "foo", price: 42, quantity: 42}]

>>> worker.checkout()
success({order-id: "238738674"})
```

REPL is a great way to test the component and its functions,
however note that it's a brand new feature and is experimental in nature.

With this we successfully tested the component functions either using `golem REPL` or `golem worker` commands.
Now we can move to exposing these worker functions as http APIs
