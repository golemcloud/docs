## Authentication in API Gateway

Golem API gateway has inbuilt authentication support to identify users using OpenID protocol.
This allows you to refer to the claims such as `request.auth.email` (as an example) once authenticated in your Rib expression.
You can choose to get pass this information into the worker function that exist in the Rib expression, and do further logic with it.
Currently, this is tested with Google Identity connector.

You can register your app with Google Identity Provider and get a client-id and client-secret for your app that is to be exposed through golem API gateway.

### Setup Security for your API routes in Golem

1. Register your app with Google Identity Provider and get a client-id and client-secret.

Here is the direct link to register your app with [Google Identity Provider](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
Here you can register your app with a name, and most importantly a redirect URL.
A typical example of a redirect url is `https://mydomain.com/auth/callback`, where `mydomain.com` is the domain in which you will be deploying your API definition in Golem.
For testing with OSS version, most probably this can be a localhost, and you can register your test application with `http://localhost:9006/auth/callback`.
The `/auth/callback` part is just an example and it can be anything, as far as it doesn't collide with any of your other paths.

Once you have setup the app-name, redirect-urls, you should be getting a client-id, client-secret from Google Identity Provider in return.
We call these details "Api Security Scheme" in Golem API Gateway.

2. Register your API Security Scheme with your app's client-id and client-secret with Golem

Make sure you name your security scheme uniquely, and provide the client-id, client-secret and redirect-url as given below.

```shell copy

golem api security-scheme create --scheme.id shopping-cart-security-scheme --provider.type google --client.id $GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --client.secret $GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET --redirect.url http://localhost:9006/auth/callback --scopes openid,email,profile

```

3. Make sure to specify your API definition that consist of the routes of your app with the security scheme id.

This is more or less inspired from open OpenAPI spec, however Golem is doing some heavy lifting here such that you only need to specify
the security scheme id and nothing else. If you are using OpenAPI spec, you can choose to provide additional details such OpenID connect URL
but it will simply be discared by Golem but it can be useful for your own documentation purposes.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
id: my-todo-api
version: 0.0.1
draft: true
security:
- my-unique-security-scheme
routes:
- method: Get
  path: /foo/{user-id}
  security: my-unique-security-scheme
  binding:
    type: wit-worker
    componentId:
      componentId: 0b6d9cd8-f373-4e29-8a5a-548e61b868a5
      version: 0
    response: |
      let email: string = request.auth.email;
      email
```

The list of security schemes at the root level is optional in the API definition. You can choose to have it or not.

However, to enable security for a route, you need to specify security scheme under each route (similar to a typical OpenAPI spec).
In the above example, the security scheme is `my-unique-security-scheme`. This is the same id that you have registered with Golem API Gateway in the previous step.

The response mapping Rib script is expecting an email field in request authentication, which will be available in the context if the user is authenticated.
More on this below. Before that, let's register and deploy the above API definition stored in api_definition.yaml file.

4. Register the API definition

As explained in previous sections, register the API definition using cloud console or golem.

```shell copy
golem api definition add api_definition.yaml  --def-format yaml
```

4. Deploy the API definition

```shell copy
golem api deployment deploy --host localhost:9006 --definition my-todo-api/0.0.1
```

With this setup, your route is accessible only by authenticated users who have logged in with Google Identity Provider.

### Testing the authenticated endpoint in Golem

In your browser, you can try to access the endpoint with the following URL:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
http://localhost:9006/foo/1
```

This should redirect you to Google Identity Provider login page, and once you login,
you should be redirected back to the original URL which is http://localhost:9006/foo/1 which will now have the claims of the user in the request context,
which you can lookup using Rib script using `request.auth.name` or `request.auth.email` etc. The claims available depends on the identity provider you are using.

If you are using Google Identity Provider, you can expect `email`, `name` etc should be available in the request context.
We will be exposing claims available in a later release of Golem to make things easier for you.

#### Redirects and Cookies

Internally, there are a couple of redirects that's going on when you access the protected endpoint.
The first redirect is to the Google Identity Provider login page as explained below, and internally this is followed by identity provider hitting the redirect URL (
which is exposed on your behalf by Golem API gateway) with all the details of the user.
This is followed by another redirect to the original URL that you tried to access, and this time the session-id, tokens/secrets set in a secure Cookie, which your
browser will resend. Once the browser sends the cookie, Golem API gateway will validate the cookie and allow you to access the protected endpoint.

We will be adding more support for various clients and usecases in future releases based on the user feedback.

#### Unexposed CallBack Endpoint

Note that the callback endpoint is exposed automatically based on the re-direct url specified in the API security scheme. Users cannot customise or add
these call back endpoints manually. This is to avoid any security issues that may arise due to misconfiguration of the callback endpoint.
