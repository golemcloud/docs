## Constraints on Components after API deployment

Please note that, once you have deployed an API using a specific component-version, then
you may not be able to update the component-version (ex: `golem component deploy`) unless
the arguments to the functions used in the Rib script in the deployed API definition is backward compatible.

If there are conflicts (i.e, backward incompatible) then you will get a conflict report message,
which details especially the missing functions and conflicting functions, where conflicting functions
detail about existing parameter types, new parameter types, existing return type, and new return type.
