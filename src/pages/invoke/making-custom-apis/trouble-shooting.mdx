## Watch out for errors during deployment

### Route conflict errors during deployment

Please note the following: If you already deployed an API definition before with the same path `/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`,
then you will receive a conflict error as given below.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
API deployment definitions conflict error: /{user-id}/get-cart-contents
```

This implies, when you update the version, you have to update the path as well, such as `/v5/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`
under the `path` field in `route`.

### Watch out for more errors during API definition and deployment updates

Please read through how to [update API definitions and deployments](/invoke/making-custom-apis/update-api-deployment)
to understand possible errors and how to manage them.

### BadRequest errors when invoking the API with inputs

If your API's implementation (Rib script which internally calls workers) gets a wrong input (Example: wrong types in http request),
it produces a `BadRequest`. This makes Golem Gateway much more type safe than a typical Gateway
where it always routes to the backend regardless of wrong inputs.

Here is an example:

```rib copy
let user: u64 = request.path.user-id;
let my-worker = instance("my-worker-${user}");
my-worker.add-cart(request.body.product);
```

Here we expect the request body to have a product field, with all the fields of the record type that `add-cart` function expects.
If the request body is wrong, we get a bad request error as shown below.

```bash copy
>
* Request completely sent off
< HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
< access-control-allow-origin: *
< content-length: 392
< date: Tue, 10 Dec 2024 03:42:54 GMT
<
* Connection #1 to host localhost left intact
Input request details don't match the requirements for rib expression to execute: Invalid value for the key path.
Error: Invalid value for the key product. Error: Expected function parameter type is u64. But found string.
Requirements. Record(TypeRecord { fields: [NameTypePair { name: "product-id", typ: U64)%

```
