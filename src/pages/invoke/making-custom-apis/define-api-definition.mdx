## Define an API definition

To begin with, let's build an API over the functions in the _shopping cart example_ (available via `golem-cli new --example rust-example-shopping-cart`):

```
$ golem-cli component get --component-name cart

Component with URN urn:component:c57de1ee-fbe5-4068-a67d-908addc8aa44. Version: 0. Component size is 2900607 bytes.
Component name: cart.
Exports:
	golem:component/api.{initialize-cart}(user-id: string)
	golem:component/api.{add-item}(item: record { product-id: string, name: string, price: f32, quantity: u32 })
	golem:component/api.{remove-item}(product-id: string)
	golem:component/api.{update-item-quantity}(product-id: string, quantity: u32)
	golem:component/api.{checkout}() -> variant { error(string), success(record { order-id: string }) }
	golem:component/api.{get-cart-contents}() -> list<record { product-id: string, name: string, price: f32, quantity: u32 }>
```

Here is an example of an API definition, which we will use to expose an HTTP API over the function `golem:component/api.{get-cart-contents}`.

```yaml
id: my-shopping-cart-v1
draft: true
version: 0.0.4
routes:
  - method: Get
    path: /v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents
    binding:
      type: wit-worker
      componentId:
        componentId: dba38841-013a-49fa-a1dc-064949832f0c
        version: 0
      workerName: |
        let user: u64 = request.path.user-id;
        my-worker-${user}
      response: |
        let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();
        {status: 200u64, body: result}
```

Please use this as a reference instead of using it with zero changes. For example, you might need to give a different
version, componentId etc (explained below). You can get the `component` details including `componentId`
by running `golem-cli component list` command.

The API definition's fields have the following meaning:

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | This field represents the unique identifier for the API definition. In this case, it is set to "shopping-cart-v1".                                                                                                                                                    |
| `version` | This field indicates the version of the API definition. Here, it is set to "0.0.3".                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `routes`  | This field contains an array of route objects, each representing a specific endpoint definition.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `method`  | Indicates the HTTP method associated with the route. In this example, it is set to "Get", indicating that this route handles GET requests.                                                                                                                            |
| `path`    | Specifies the URL path pattern for the route. It may include path parameters enclosed in curly braces. Here, the path is `/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`, indicating that this route handles requests to retrieve the contents of a shopping cart for a specific user. |
| `binding` | This object contains information about how the request should be handled by the Golem worker.                                                                                                                                                                         |

### Golem Binding

Let's break down the binding object.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`        | Specifies the type of binding. Here, it is set to "wit-worker", indicating that the binding involves a Golem worker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `componentId` | Provides the component ID associated with the worker binding. As you can see the the golem-worker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `workerName`  | Specifies the Name of the Golem worker responsible for handling the request. Here it is `my-worker-${request.path.user-id}`. The value that is wrapped in code block (starting with `${` and ending with `}`) will be a Rib expression. Here `request.path.user-id` is a valid Rib expression where it selects the field `path` from the `request` block, and further selects `user-id` from it. |
| `response`    | The `response` field here is a Rib expression that allows you to call any worker function and manipulates its output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

Note that workerName and response are actually rib expressions. It gives you the flexibility to make necessary changes to the input and output to a worker function,
as well as dynamically create a worker name.

If your worker name is a constant, the you can simply make it a constant string such as `"foo"`. Please note that it has to be quoted for it a valid Rib string.
See the [Rib reference](/rib) for the full reference of the binding language.

In this example, the following Rib expression defines the request:

```
let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();
{status: 200u64, body: result}

```

The first line is about calling the worker-function and assigning its result to the variable `result`. The last line is a WASM record where you are mapping to the response. Here body is `result` itself.
That means, we are not manipulating the result returned by the function, and simply forward it as response body. Status is 200u64. `u64` is the type of the number
as Rib is typed and it needs to know the full type of the WASM record. `200u64` is equivalent to `let x: u64 = 200; x;` in Rib.

As mentioned above, see the [Rib reference](/rib) to know more about Rib language.
