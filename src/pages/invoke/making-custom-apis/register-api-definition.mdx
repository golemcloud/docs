## Upload API definition

The API definitions can be uploaded to Golem using one of the following methods:

- Use the [Golem CLI](/cli) tool
- Use the [Rest APIs](/rest-api)
- Use [Golem Console](https://console.golem.cloud/) (Only available in Golem Cloud)

The following example uses `golem` to add a new API definition to the system.

```shell copy
golem api definition add api-definition.json --def-format yaml
```

This API definition is still a **draft** since it is still not `deployed` yet.
Once it is deployed you cannot further update this definition unless you change the version, to avoid breaking your public API.
