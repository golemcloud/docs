## Update API definitions and deployments

### Deploying multiple definitions to the same site

Multiple API definitions can be deployed to a specific site (subdomain.domain),
as far their routes don't conflict.

Example: Let's say we have an API definition with ID/version `my-shopping-cart/0.0.1` deployed in domain `localhost:9006` ,
and we want to deploy another registered definition `my-todo-app/0.0.1` to the same domain.

```shell copy
golem api deployment deploy --host localhost:9006  my-todo-app/0.0.1
```

API deployment on localhost:9006 with definition my-shopping-cart/0.0.1
API deployment on localhost:9006 with definition my-todo-app/0.0.1

```

Now all the routes are available under the same domain `localhost:9006`. If there are any conflicts between the
routes of the two definitions, you will get a conflict error message.

If you try to deploy an API definition with routes that are already deployed and live,
then you will get a conflict error.

Example:

```shell copy
$ golem api deployment deploy --host localhost:9006 --definition my-todo-app/0.0.1

API deployment definitions conflict error: /v1/healthcheck
```

### Update a deployed API definition without bumping up it's version

Let's say you want to update the existing API definition that is already deployed without changing its
version number.

```shell copy
$ golem api definition update  my-shopping-cart --def-format my-shopping-cart.yaml

API definition is not draft: my-shopping-cart
```

API definition is not draft because the particular version is already deployed and you cannot
update its routes and register with the same version. If the API definition is not in draft mode,
and you tried to update the definition itself, then you will get an error message as shown above.

### Update a deployed API definition by bumping up it's version

If you want to update the details of an API definition that is already deployed, you can bump up its version
and registering it again. API Gateway will consider it as a new API definition, and allows you to deploy it
as far as there are no conflicts with the existing routes.

In the below example, lets assume we bumped up the version number from 0.0.1 to 0.0.2 in my-shopping-cart.yaml
(and also updated its routes such that they don't conflict)

```shell copy
$ golem api definition new  my-shopping-cart.yaml
$ golem api deployment deploy --host localhost:9006 my-shopping-cart/0.0.2                          Tue 10 Dec 14:57:22 2024

API deployment on localhost:9006 with definition my-shopping-cart/0.0.1
API deployment on localhost:9006 with definition my-shopping-cart/0.0.2
```

You can see both versions are running now in the same domain `localhost:9006`.
You can list all the deployments in a domain for a particular API definition ID (my-shopping-cart) as given below

```shell copy
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:9005/v1/api/deployments?api-definition-id=my-shopping-cart'
```

```json
[
  {
    "apiDefinitions": [
      {
        "id": "my-shopping-cart",
        "version": "0.0.1"
      },
      {
        "id": "my-shopping-cart",
        "version": "0.0.2"
      }
    ],
    "createdAt": "2024-12-10T04:21:54.872613+00:00",
    "site": {
      "host": "localhost:9006",
      "subdomain": null
    }
  }
]
```

As mentioned earlier, if you try to deploy a new version of an existing API definition or a completely new API definition,
with conflicting routes, you will get a conflict error message during deployment.
At this point, you can update the routes in the new API definition and try and deploy it again.
