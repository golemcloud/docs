# Rib

**Rib** is the language used by the [API Gateway](concepts/worker-gateway) that enables users to write programs capable of manipulating worker responses, which are WebAssembly (WASM) values.

Rib uses the [WAVE (WebAssembly Value Encoding)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) syntax for encoding values.

## Rib Grammar

```

The grammar is mainly to give a high level overview of the syntax of Rib.

The following sections show some examples of each construct.

Rib scripts can be multiline, and it should be separated by `;`.

### Return type of a Rib script

The last expression in the Rib script is the return value of the script. The last line in Rib script
shouldn't end with a `;`, as this is a syntax error.

Let's see how we can write Rib corresponding to the types supported by the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html)

## Core Language Elements

### Identifier

```rib copy
foo
```

Here `foo` is an identifier. Note that identifiers are not wrapped with quotes.

Rib will fail at compilation if variable `foo` is not available in the context.

This implies, if you are running Rib specifying a wasm `component` through `api-gateway` in `golem`, then `Rib` has the access to look at component metadata.
If `Rib` finds this variable `foo` in the component metadata,then it tries to infer its types.

If such a variable is not present in the wasm component (i.e, you can cross check this in WIT file of the component),
then technically there are two possibilities. Rib will choose to fail the compilation or consider it as a global variable input.
A global input is nothing but `Rib` expects `foo` to be passed in to the evaluator of Rib script (somehow).



Since you are using `Rib` from the api-gateway part of `golem` the only valid global variable supported is `request` and nothing else.
This would mean, it will fail compilation.

Example:

```rib copy

my-worker-function(request)

```

`request` here is a global input and Rib knows the type of `request` if `my-worker-function` is a valid function in the component (which acts as dependencies to Rib)


Here are a few other examples of identifiers:

```rib copy
foo-bar
FOO-BAR
```

More on global inputs to follow.

### Primitives

https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#primitive-types

#### Numbers

```rib copy
1
```

You can annotate a type to Rib expression to make it specific, otherwise, it will get inferred as u64
for a positive integer, s64 for a signed integer, and f64 for a floating point number.

```rib copy
1: u64
```


#### Boolean
```rib copy
true
```

```rib copy
false
```

#### String

```rib copy
"foo"
```


### Lists

```rib copy
# Sequence of numbers
[1, 2, 3]
```

You can annotate the type of the list as follows:

```rib copy
let x: list<s32> = [1, 2, 3];
```

```rib copy
["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```

```rib copy
# Sequence of record
[{a: "foo"}, {b : "bar"}]
```

### Options

`Option` in corresponding to WASM , which can take the shape of `Some` or `None`. This is similar to `Option` type in std `Rust`.

An `Option` can be `Some` of a value, or `None`.

```rib copy
 some(1)
```

```rib copy
 none
```

You can annotate the type of option as follows, if needed.

```rib copy
let x: option<u32> = none;
```

The syntax is inspired from wasm wave.


### Results

`Result`in `Rib` is WASM Result, which can take the shape of `ok` or `err`. This is similar to `Result` type in std `Rust`.

A `Result` can be `Ok` of a value, or an `Err` of a value.

```rib copy
 ok(1)
```

```rib copy
 err("error")
```

```rib copy

{
  "user": "ok(Alice)",
  "age": 30u32
}
```

Note that there are various [possibilities](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#results) of `result` in Web Assembly component model.

If there is no data associated with the error case, you can do the following:

```rib copy
let my-result: result<_, string> = err("foo")
my-result
```

If there are no data associated with the success case, you can do the following:

```rib copy
let my-result: result<string> = ok("foo")

```

If you don't care the type of success and error.

```rib copy
let my-result: result = ok("foo")
```

When using `rib`, we recommend using the mostly used pattern which is to know both the success and error case (i.e, `result<u32, string>`)

### Tuples

A tuple type is an ordered fixed length sequence of values of specified types. It is similar to a record,
except that the fields are identified by their order instead of by names.

```rib copy
(1, 20.1, "foo")
```

This is also equivalent to the following in Rib.
You can be specific about the types just like in any rib expression.

```rib copy
let my-tuple: tuple<u64, f64, string> = (1, 20.1, "foo");
my-tuple
```

Unlike `list`, the values in a tuple can be of different types.

Here is another example:

```rib copy
("foo", 1, {a: "bar"})
```

### Record

```rib copy
{ name: "John", age: 30 }

{ city: "New York", population: 8000000 }

{ name: "John", age: 30, { country: "France", capital: "Paris" } }
```

This is parsed as a `WASM` Record. The syntax is inspired from `WASM-WAVE`.

Note that, sometimes you will need to annotate the type of the number. It depends on the compilation context.

Note that keys are not considered as variables. Also note that keys in a WASM record don't have quotes. Example: `{"foo" : "bar"}` is wrong.

### Variants
Let say your WIT file has the following [variant](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#variants)

```

variant bid-result {
   success,
   failure(string),
}

bid: func() -> bid-result;

process-result: func(res: bid-result) -> string

```


Then, in Rib, all you need to is simply use the variant terms directly. Example:

```rib copy
let x = failure("its failed");
x
```

You can pattern match (more on this [patter-match](#pattern-matching) below) on variants as follows:

```rib copy
let x = failure("its failed");

let result = match x { success => "its success", failure(msg) => msg }

result
```

This will return "its failed".

Here is the example WIT file and the corresponding rib scripts that shows how to pass
variants as arguments to worker function. More explanation on how to invoke worker function using
rib is explained [further down below](#invoke-worker-functions).

```
  variant bid-result {
    success(string),
    failure(string)
  }

  handle: func(res: bid-result) -> string;

```


```rib copy
let worker = instance("my_worker");
worker.handle(failure("it's failed"));
```


```rib copy
let worker = instance("my_worker");
worker.handle(success);
```


```rib copy
let worker = instance("my_worker");
let bid-result = worker.bid();
let result = worker.handle(bid-result);
result

```

Note that rib script should have the dependency to the component that defines the variant.
Otherwise, Rib will fail with compilation.

```
failure("its failed")
[invalid script] error in the following rib found at line 1, column 203
`failure("its failed")`
cause: invalid function call `failure`
unknown function

```

If Rib is used through API gateway and not directly, this dependency is already added automatically as you
specify component name when defining API definition.

### Enums

Let's say your WIT file has the following [enum](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html#enums) types,

```
  enum status {
    backlog,
    in-progress,
    done,
  }

  enum priority {
    low,
    medium,
    high,
  }


```

Then, in Rib, all you need to do is to simply specify the name of the term. Example by typing in `backlog`, it knows its an enum type
which can be any of `backlog`, `in-progress` and `done`.

```rib copy
let my-status = backlog;
let my-priory = priority;
{s: my-status, p: my-priority}
```

You can pattern match (more on this [pattern-match](#pattern-matching) below) on enum values as follows

```rib copy

let my-priority = low;

let result = match my-priority {
  low => "its low",
  medium => "its medium",
  high => "its high"
};

result
```

This will return the result "its low".

Here is the example WIT file and the corresponding rib scripts that shows how to pass
variants as arguments to worker function. More explanation on how to invoke worker function using
rib is explained [further down below](#invoke-worker-functions).

```
  enum status {
    backlog,
    in-progress,
    done,
  }

  enum priority {
    low,
    medium,
    high,
  }

  process-user: func(status: status, priority: priority, user-id: string) -> string;


```

```rib copy

let worker = instance("my_worker");
let result = worker.process-user(backlog, low, "jon");
result

```

```rib copy
let worker = instance("my_worker");
let status = in-progress;
let priority = medium;
let result = worker.process-user(status, priority, "jon");
result
```

Note that rib script should have the dependency to the component that defines the enum.
Otherwise, Rib will fail with compilation.

If Rib is used through API gateway and not directly, this dependency is already added automatically as you
specify component name when defining API definition.

### Flags

```rib copy
{ Foo, Bar, Baz }
```

This is of a flag type.


## Expressions and Syntax Features

### Assign to a variable

This can be done using `let` binding which we have already seen in the above examples

```rib copy
let x = 1;
```

We can annotate the type of the variable as well.


```rib copy
let x: u64 = 1;
```

If you are passing this variable to a worker function, then you may not need to specify the type of the variable.


### String Interpolation (concatenation)

This is similar to languages like `scala` where you start with `${` and end with `}`

```rib copy
let x = "foo";
let y = "bar";
let z = "${x}-and-${y}";
```

Evaluating this Rib will result in "foo-and-bar". The type of `z` is a string.


### Selection of Field

A field can be selected from an `Rib` expression if it is a `Record` type. For example, `foo.user`
is a valid selection given `foo` is a variable that gets evaluated to a record value.

```rib copy
let foo = { name: "John", age: 30 };
foo.name
```

### Selection of Index

This is selecting an index from a sequence value.

```rib copy
let x = [1, 2, 3];
x[0]
```

You can also inline as given below

```rib copy
[1, 2, 3][0]
```


### Comparison (Boolean)

```rib copy
let x: u8 = 1;
let y: u8 = 2;
x == y

```

Similarly, we can use other comparison operators like `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `<` etc.
Both operands should be a valid Rib code that points/evaluated to a number or string.

### Arithmetic

```rib copy
let x: u8 = 1;
let y: u8 = 2;
x + y
```

`+`, `-`, `/` and `*` are supported.


## Collections and Control Structures

### List Comprehension

```rib copy
 let x = ["foo", "bar"];

 for p in x {
   yield p;
 }
```

### List Aggregation

```rib copy
 let ages: list<u16> = [1, 2, 3];

 reduce z, a in ages from 0 {
   yield z + a;
 }
```

### Ranges

Ranges can be right exclusive or right inclusive. The right exclusive range is denoted by `..` and right inclusive range is denoted by `..=`.


```rib copy
1..10;
```

```rib copy
let initial: u32 = 1;
let final: u32 = 10;

let x = initial..final;

for i in x {
  yield i
}
```

Similarly, you can use `..=` to include the last number in the range.



```rib copy
1..=10;
```


```rib copy
let initial: u32 = 1;
let final: u32 = 10;

let x = initial..=final;

for i in x {
  yield i
}
```

Please note that, you may need to help Rib compiler with type annotations for the numbers involved in the range.
This depends on the context. We will improve these aspects as we go.

You can also create infinite range, where you skip the right side of `..`

```rib copy
1..;
```

However, note that as of now Rib interpreter (runtime) will spot any infinite loop and will throw an error.
Example: The following will throw an error.

```rib copy
let x = 1:u8..;

for i in x {
  yield i
}
```

However, you can use infinite ranges to select a segment of the list without worrying about the end index.

```rib copy
let x: list<u32> = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

for i in x[1..] {
  yield i
}
```

### Pattern Matching

```rib copy
let res: result<str, str> = ok("foo");

match res {
    ok(v) => v,
    err(msg) => msg
}
```

This would probably be your go-to construct when you are dealing with complex data structures like `result` or `option` or other custom `variant` (WASM Variant)
that comes out as the response of a worker function

```rib copy
  let worker_result = my_worker_function_name(1, "jon");
  match worker_result {
     ok(x) => "foo",
     err(msg) => "error"
  }
```

#### Exhaustive pattern matching

If the pattern match is not exhaustive, then it will throw compilation errors

Example: The following pattern matching is invalid

```rib copy
  match worker_result {
    some(x) => "found",
  }
```

This will result in following error:

```
Error: Non-exhaustive pattern match. The following patterns are not covered: `none`.
To ensure a complete match, add these patterns or cover them with a wildcard (`_`) or an identifier.
```

Now, let's say your worker responded with a `variant`.
Note on variant: A variant statement defines a new type where instances of the type match exactly one of the variants listed for the type.
This is similar to a "sum" type in algebraic datatype (or an enum in Rust if you're familiar with it).
Variants can be thought of as tagged unions as well.

#### Pattern Match on Variants

Given you are using Rib through worker bridge, which knows about component metadata,
then, let's say we have a variant of type as given below responded from the `worker`, when invoking a function called `foo`:

```rib copy
variant my_variant {
    bar( {a: u32,b: string }),
    foo(list<string>),
}
```

then, the following will work:

```rib copy
let x = foo("abc");

match x {
  bar({a: _, b: _}) => "success",
  foo(some_list) => some_list[0]
}

```

#### Variables in the context of pattern matching

In all of the above, there exist a variable in the context of pattern.
Example `x` in `ok(x)` or `msg` in `err(msg)` or `x` in `some(x)` or `x` in `bar(x)` or `x` in `foo(x)`.

These variables are bound to the value that is being matched.

Example, given the worker response is ok(1), the following match expression will result in `2`.

```rib copy
   let result = my-worker-function("foo");

   match result {
    ok(x) => x + 1,
    err(msg) => 0
  }
```

The following match expression will result in "c", if the worker response was variant value `foo(["a", "b", "c"])`,
and will result in "a" if the `worker.response` was variant value `bar({a: 1, b: "a"})`.

```rib copy
  let result = my-worker-function();

  match result {
    bar(x) => x.b,
    foo(x) => x[1]
  }

```

#### Wild card patterns

In some of the above examples, the binding variables are unused. We can use `_` as a wildcard pattern to indicate that we don't care about the value.

```rib copy
  match worker.response {
    bar(_) => "bar",
    foo(_) => "foo"
  }
```

### Conditional Statement

```rib copy
 let id: u32 = 10;
 if id > 3 then "higher" else "lower"
```

The structure of the conditional statement is `if <condition> then <then-rib-expr> else <else-rib-expr>`,
where `condition-expr` is an expr that should get evaluated to boolean.
The `then-rib-expr` or `else-rib-expr` can be an any valid rib code, which could be another `if else` itself

```rib copy
 let id: u32 = request.user.id;
 if id > 3 then "higher" else if id == 3 then "equal" else "lower"
```

You must ensure that the branches (then branch and else branch) resolve to the same type. Otherwise, Rib
will fail to compile.


## External Interactions

### Http Request Input and Field Selection

Rib is currently mainly used in worker-gateway which will allow us to expose Http APIs on top of worker functions.
If you are using Rib in the context of [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis) then
you can use the variable `request` in your Rib script, which allows you to access various parameters of input Http request.
In other words, `request` is a global input to the Rib script when used in API definitions, and
`worker-gateway` will ensure to pass the value of `request` to the rib evaluator internally.

Please refer to [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis) documents for more details.

`request` will hold all the details of an input Http request in gateway,
such as headers, path, query parameters and body.

#### Request Body Parameters
To select the body field in request,

```rib copy
request.body.user
```

#### Request Header Parameters

To select a header from the request

```rib copy
request.headers.user
```

#### Request Path Parameters

To select the value of a path variable in your http request `/v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`

```rib copy
request.path.user-id
```

#### Request Query Parameters

To select the value of a query variable in your http request `/v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents?{country}`

```rib copy
request.query.country
```

The `request.path.*` and `request.headers.*` will be inferred as `string` unless you specify it using type annotation.

Example:
```rib
let user-id: u8 = request.path.user-id;
```

To select the value of a query variable in your http request `/v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents?{country}`

```rib
let country: string = request.query.country;
```

#### A typical Rib script in API definition (worker gateway)

Here is a full example of a Rib script that look up various elements in a Http Request.

Given the route is `/v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents?{country}` , which is a POST request,
which has a body, then the following Rib script can be valid, and has a dependency to a component
that has a function `my-function` that takes two arguments of type `{foo: string, bar: string}` and `string`


```rib
let user-id: u8 = request.path.user-id;
let country: string = request.query.country;
let input = request.body;
let worker = instance("my-worker-${user-id}");
let result = worker.my-function(input, country);
result
```

This Rib script will be part of an API definition (please refer to [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis) for more details)
When registering this API definition, it already keeps track of the requirements of the input http request.
In this case, the input request is a POST request with a body, and the body is of type `{foo: string, bar: string}`,
and the path variable is `user-id` of type `u8`, and the query parameter is `country` of type `string`.

Once the API is deployed and the API is invoked, worker gateway will validate the input request against these requirements,
and if they don't satisfy, it results in a BadRequest error.

Please note the language Rib by itself don't support a keyword such as `request`, or `path` or `body` or `headers`.
The above examples are valid only if are using Rib through [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis).
If Rib script is evaluated in the context of a http request, these values are available in the context of the Rib evaluator.

Currently, there are two ways to use `Rib` in golem. One is [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis)
and the other is golem REPL. In the case of REPL, `request` is not available, since we are not executing Rib in the context of an Http request.

Here is an example of an invalid Rib script

```rib

request

```

```rib
request.body
```

In the above case, compiler is not able to infer the type of `request` or `request.body`
as it is not passed as an argument to a worker function.

### Invoke worker functions

Rib is mainly used to write scripts to manipulate the input and call worker functions.
Refer to the [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis) documentation for more on how you use Rib to invoke worker functions.
This is useful to expose some http APIs on top of these worker functions running in golem platform, and you don't want to keep
updating or change the components and expose additional APIs, as you can write a simple Rib script to do the necessary changes to the input
and pass it to the worker functions. Invoking functions is similar to any other languages.

#### Durable worker function invocation

```rib copy
let my_worker = instance("my-worker");
let result = my_worker.get-cart-contents();

result
```

Rib is evaluated in the context of a particular component (this is taken care by worker-gateway that it evaluates Rib in the context of a wasm component).

In this script, first you create an instance (instance of a component) using `instance` function. `instance` function takes
worker name as the argument. Once you created the instance, the functions in the component will be available to call.

#### Ephemeral Worker function invocation

The only difference here is that you don't need to pass an argument to the `instance` function.

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance();
let result = my_worker.get-cart-contents();
result
```

You can avoid an unnecessary let-binding here too.

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance();
my_worker.get-cart-contents();
```

In this case the return value of the script is the last expression in the script, and in this case, it is of the result type of `get-cart-contents`.


#### Worker function invocation with arguments

Let's say there exists a  function `add-to-cart` which takes a product as the argument, where product is a wasm record

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};
my_worker.add-to-cart(input);
```

Similarly you can pass multiple arguments to the worker function and they should be separated by `,`.

Say you need to pass the username along with with the product details.

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};
let username = "foo";

my_worker.add-to-cart(username, product);
```

You can inline the arguments as well.

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};
my_worker.add-to-cart("foo", {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"});
```

#### Invoke functions in a Resource

Here is a relatively complex example where Rib is used to invoke functions in a resource `cart`
Here the first step is to define the worker by calling instance function. Then you create a resource
similar to a method invocation which is `worker.cart`. Here the only difference is `cart` is a resource
rather than a function. Now you have the resource available to call methods on it such as `add-item`, `remove-item` etc.

Please note that, everything prior to a real function call is lazy. i.e, you are not reusing the same resource at runtime
to call these functions.

```rib copy
  let worker = instance("my-worker");
  let cart = worker.cart("bar");
  cart.add-item({product-id: "mac", name: "apple", quantity: 1, price: 1});
  cart.remove-item(a);
  cart.update-item-quantity(a, 2);
  let result = cart.get-cart-contents();
  cart.drop();
  result
```

#### Handle conflicting function names using type parameters

Let's say a function name `add-to-cart` exists in multiple interfaces (say api1, api2) in the same component.
In this case, you can specify the interface as a type parameter when invoking method in the instance.

Example:

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};

let result = my_worker.add-to-cart[api1](product);

result
```

If you are not specifying type parameter that narrows down the context, then compiler will return an error similar to the below one:

```
error in the following rib found at line 3, column 30
`my_worker.add-to-cart(product)`
cause: invalid function call `qux`
function 'add-to-cart' exists in multiple interfaces. specify an interface name as type parameter from: api1, api2
```

#### Handle conflicting packages using type parameters

Let's say a function name `add-to-cart` exists in multiple packages. In this case, you can specify the package name too
as a type parameter. Let's say you care only about the package `amazon:shopping-cart`.


```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};

let result = my_worker.add-to-cart[amazon:shopping-cart](product);

result
```

#### Handle conflicts at instance level

You can also include this type parameter at instance level such that every method invocation will be resolved to that package or interface.

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance[amazon:shopping-cart]("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};

let result = my_worker.add-to-cart(product);
```

#### Conflict resolution using fully qualified type parameter

If there exist a function `add-to-cart` in multiple interfaces within multiple packages, then you can specify
fully qualified package name and interface as given below. As mentioned above, this can be either at instance level
(which will get applied to all method calls on that instance) or at method level

```rib copy
let my_worker_instance = instance[amazon:shopping-cart/api]("my-worker");

let product = {product-id: 1, quantity: 2, name: "mac"};

let result = my_worker.add-to-cart(product);
```

#### Multiple invocations

Rib allows you to invoke a function multiple times, or invoke multiple functions across multiple workers in a single script.
That said, it is important to note that Rib by itself is not durable and is stateless. The next time you invoke Rib (through worker-gateway for example),
these functions will get executed against the worker again and doesn't cache any result in anyway.

Let's say we want to accumulate the contents of a shopping cart from user-id 1 to user-id 5.

```rib copy
  let worker = instance("my-worker");
  let cart = worker.cart[golem:it/api]("bar");

  let initial = 1: u64;
  let final = 5: u64;
  let range = initial..final;

  let result = for i in range {
     yield cart.get-cart-contents("user-id-${i}");
  };

  result

```

Currently Rib is not durable. Also it hasn't been tested with complex use-cases such as invoking multiple functions,
or invoke functions against multiple workers. This is because, Rib's primary use-case in golem platform is for users to write reasonably simple
scripts in the context of [worker-gateway](/invoke/making-custom-apis) to manipulate the http input and call worker functions.


## Type Inference

Rib is mainly used to write script to manipulate the input and call worker functions. In this case, for the most part, most of the types
will be automatically inferred. Otherwise, there will be a compilation error, asking the developer to annotate the types and help the compiler.


```rib copy
let x: string = request.body;
x
```

Say the request body is a `record` in Json, as given below. `Rib` sees it as a `WASM` Record type.

```rib copy
{
  "user": "Alice",
  "age": 30u32
}
```

Then we can use Rib language to select the field `user`, as it considers this request's body as a `WASM` Record type.

```rib copy
let x: string = request.body.user;
x
```


## Limitations

We recommend the users of golem to not rely on Rib for complex business logic as of now.
It's better to write it in standard languages that works with golem such as Rust, Python etc,
making sure your logic or workflow is durable. We will be expanding the usability and reliability of Rib as we go.

## Issues and Trouble Shooting

If you bump into compilation errors, annotating the types will help the compiler to infer the types properly.
If you bump into internal runtime errors, please report to us and we will try to fix it as soon as possible.

We are making improvements in this space continuously.
