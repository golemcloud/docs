# API definition Binding Types

## Overview

The binding types are a collection of different ways that a worker can be exposed to the outside world as part of an api definition.

To get a basic introduction of what api-definitions are and how bindings fit into them, please read the defining custom apis [guide](/invoke/making-custom-apis).

## Rib Scripts

Bindings can execute code as part of various steps in the request lifecycle. All of these scripts use a scripting language
called rib. You can find an introduction to the language [here](/rib).

### Default Binding

The default and most basic binding type that allows invoking workers in custom ways.

Example:

```yaml
routes:
  - method: Get
    # Define the path that the route will apply to. {var} patterns capture the path segments and make it available for scripts.
    path: /carts/{cart-id}/checkout
    binding:
      type: default
      componentName: checkout-component
      response: |
        let name = request.path.cart-id;
        let worker = instance(name);
        let response = golem:it/api.{{checkout}}();
        let status: u64 = 200;
        {{headers: {{ContentType: "json"}}, body: response, status: status}}
```

Parameters:

| Parameter               | Required | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| component.name | true     | string | Name of the component to invoke                                                                                                                                       |
| component.version     | false     | number | Version of the component to invoke. If not provided, the latest version is used.                                                                                                                                 |
| workerName              | false    | rib    | Script used to compute the name of the worker that will be invoked. The script has access to the request input. If not provided, an ephemeral worker is used.                                                                                                       |
| idempotencyKey          | false    | rib    | Script used to compute the idempotency key. The script has access to the request input. If not provided an idempotency key will be generated.                                                                                                                       |
| response                | true     | rib    | Script that is used to compute the response that will be returned to the user. The script has access to the request and worker inputs and can call worker functions. The result of the script has to be an object with status and optional headers and body fields. |

### Cors Binding Type

This binding type is used to add CORS support to an api. To use this binding type, install it to a separate route with the same
path as your main api and an OPTIONS method. Any OPTIONS requests will be automatically answered with the configured cors headers.

Any requests to your actual api will also include the CORS response headers.

The documentation you are already familiar with CORS and what the function of each of the headers are. For more information
regarding CORS, see the [mdn docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CORS).

Example:

```yaml
routes:
  - method: Options
    path: /users/{user-id}
    binding:
      type: cors-preflight
    # Another definition for the same route and a different method.
    # The cors-preflight binding will enable cors for this binding.
  - method: Get
    path: /users/{user-id}
    binding:
      componentName: example-component
      response: |
        {status: 200u64, body: "Hello World"}
```

You can customise the CORS by providing a `response` Rib script which should be a record that contains CORS parameters

```yaml
routes:
  - method: Options
    path: /users/{user-id}
    binding:
      type: cors-preflight
      response: |
      {
        Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "mysite.com",
        Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS",
        Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Content-Type, Authorization",
        Access-Control-Expose-Headers: "Content-Length, X-Requested-With",
        Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true,
        Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400u64
      }
    # Another definition for the same route and a different method.
    # The cors-preflight binding will enable cors for this binding.
  - method: Get
    path: /users/{user-id}
    binding:
      componentName: example-component
      response: |
        {status: 200u64, body: "Hello World"}
```

### File Server

A binding type that is used to retrieve files from a workers filesystem. For read-write files the file is retrieved between running worker invocation, so users
are guaranteed to not see any in-progress changes to files.

For read-only files the files are retrieved from a separate datastore and not directly from the worker. This makes retrieving read-only files very cheap
and allows it be used for serving static content.

To learn more about the worker filesystem, check out the [dedicated guide](/common-language-guide/worker-filesystem).

Example:

```yaml
routes:
  - method: Get
    # {+var} patterns capture all remaining path segments
    path: /workers/{worker-name}/files/{+file}
    binding:
      type: file-server
      componentName: example-component
      # retrieve the path /files/${{file}} from the worker and return the content.
      response: 'let file: string = request.path.file; "/files/${{file}}"'
```

Parameters:

| Parameter               | Required | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                         |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| component.name | true     | string | Name of the component to invoke                                                                                                                                       |
| component.version     | false     | number | Version of the component to invoke. If not provided, the latest version is used.                                                                                                                                 |
| workerName              | false    | rib    | Script used to compute the name of the worker that will be invoked. The script has access to the request input. If not provided, an ephemeral worker is used.       |
| idempotencyKey          | false    | rib    | Script used to compute the idempotency key. The script has access to the request input. If not provided an idempotency key will be generated.                       |
| response                | true     | rib    | Script that is used to compute the file to retrieve and the response to send to users. See the dedicatedc [section](#file-server-response-object) for more details. |

#### File Server Response Object

The object returned from the response rib script warrants some extra mention.
There are two different structures that are supported by golem:

1. Returning a single string. The returned string is interepreted as an absolute path and looked up in the worker filesystem and returned with an inferred content type and a 200 status code.
   If the file does not exist, a 404 is returned instead.

2. As an object. This object can have 3 different fields that are explained below:
   | Field | Required | Rib Type | Description |
   | --------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
   | headers | false | record | Headers that should be included in the response. |
   | status | false | u64 | Status code of the response. If not provided defaults to 200. |
   | file-path | true | string | Path of the file that should be retrieved from the worker filesystem. If the file does not exist a 404 is returned |

### Http Handler

A binding type used for integrating with components that implement the wasi:http/proxy world.
The binding will forward the incoming requests to the worker and return the responses back to the user.

Example:

```yaml
# Each user has it's own worker that directly implements the user api using wasi:http/incoming-handler.
# Define routes to forward the traffic to the workers.
routes:
  - method: Get
    path: /users/{user}
    binding:
      type: http-handler
      componentName: user-component
      workerName: 'let name: string = request.path.user; name'
  - method: Get
    path: /users/{user}/{+user-route}
    binding:
      type: http-handler
      componentName: user-component
      workerName: 'let name: string = request.path.user; name'
```

Parameters:

| Parameter               | Required | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                   |

| component.version     | false     | number | Version of the component to invoke. If not provided, the latest version is used.                                                                                                                                 |
| workerName              | false    | rib    | Script used to compute the name of the worker that will be invoked. The script has access to the request input. If not provided, an ephemeral worker is used. |
| idempotencyKey          | false    | rib    | Script used to compute the idempotency key. The script has access to the request input. If not provided an idempotency key will be generated.                 |
