# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

The WASM component model eliminates the need for microservice architectures, 
since components written in different languages can interact with each other 
in-process (through component composition), without having to go through 
remote protocols like HTTP, gRPC, or JSON RPC.

Despite this, however, there are times when remote procedure calls (RPC) are 
useful or necessary when developing applications on Golem:

1. You want to parallelize computation that cannot be done on a single worker, 
   either due to lack of memory or lack of compute.
2. You want to partition state that is too large to store on a single worker; 
   or, perhaps, you want to partition state that can fit on a single worker, but 
   cannot be read and written fast enough due to heavy contention.

Both of these are examples of distributed systems, where some combination of 
state and computation is distributed for reasons of reducing latency. 

To build a system that distributes storage or compute, it is necessary to 
coordinate work through communication&mdash;a job that requires RPC of some 
kind, even if it's just an HTTP API.

Recognizing the critical nature of communication for many distributed systems,
Golem provides a feature called _worker-to-worker communication_. This feature 
allows you to simply, and in a type-safe way, communicate between workers, 
with strong guarantees, such as exactly-once communication semantics.
