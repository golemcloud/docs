# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

In server-based programming, the fundamental unit of work is the _server_, which
accepts incoming connections, and handles requests by generating responses.

In Golem, which is a serverless computing platform, the fundamental unit of
work is the _worker_. A worker is a _running instance_ of a component, with a
unique identity, which allows addressing specific workers.

Workers are similar to _lambdas_ or _functions_ in other serverless computing
platforms, but they are far more powerful and expressive.

<Callout type="info">
  The relationship between a component and a worker is the same as the relationship between an
  executable and a process: processes are running instances of executables. While the executable
  contains mostly code, which awaits execution, a process contains both code, as well as dynamic
  state, which captures work-in-progress.

# Worker Essentials

The fundamental elements of every worker include:

- **Identity**. Every worker has a unique identity, which allows addressing
  specific workers.
- **State**. Every worker has state, including memory, environment variables,
  and file system.
- **API**. Every worker has a public API, defined by its component.

These core elements are discussed in the sections that follow.

## Identity

Every worker has a globally unique identity, which is formed from the
following elements:

- **Component ID**. Every component deployed on Golem has a globally
  unique identity (UUID), which is assigned by Golem when a new component
  is uploaded to Golem.
- **Worker Name**. The worker name can be chosen by you for each worker.
  If you do not need to address specific workers, you can also use a UUID for
  the worker name. The only constraint is that worker names must be unique
  within the scope of their component.

The unique identity of workers allows them to be addressed individually,
which unlocks many powerful patterns for building distributed systems.

## State

Workers are inherently stateful, in the same way that any running process
is stateful. Workers have the following stateful elements:

- **Memory**. A worker has in-memory state, such as global variables, stack,
  and so on, which constantly changes over the life of the worker.
- **Environment Variables**. A worker has environment variables, which it
  inherits from component settings and any initial settings when the worker is
  created, and which may change over time.
- **File System**. A worker has a file system, which currently starts out
  empty, but which may evolve over the life of the worker.
- **Status**. The status of the worker, managed by Golem, is one of the
  following: running, idle, suspended, interrupted, retrying, failed, or
  exited.

State also includes something called the _instruction pointer_, which is not
accessible in most programming languages, but which tracks which location in the
code the CPU is currently executing.

## API

Workers are running instances of components. Because components have a public
API, which is defined by WIT, workers inherit this API.

To perform work, such as handling a request, you _invoke_ a worker's public API.
This process is referred to as _invocation_, and you can learn more in the
section on [invocation](/docs/concepts/invocations.mdx).

# Worker Guarantees

Golem executes workers with strong guarantees. To understand these guarantees,
you should read the section on [reliability](/docs/concepts/reliability.mdx).

However, in brief, Golem provides the following guarantees:

- **Transactional Execution**. Workers are executed transactionally. Once a
  worker is started, it will be executed to completion, even in the presence of
  faults, restarts, or updates. It's perfectly acceptable to use workers for
  high-value use cases, such as financial transaction processing; or for
  implementing APIs that coordinate updates across multiple systems.
- **Durable State**. All worker state, including in-memory state, is durable,
  and can be treated as automatically persistent. This means that state
  survives failures, restarts, and updates without the loss of any
  information. Workers may treat their memory as a database, and use it to
  persist state indefinitely and across any number of invocations.
- **Reliable Internal Communication**. Workers can communicate with each other
  using their public APIs, in a type-safe way. Worker-to-worker communication
  is reliable, with exactly-once semantics, and can be used to build
  sophisticated and stateful distributed systems.
- **Resilient External Communication**. Workers can freely communicate with
  external systems, such as databases, message queues, and APIs. External
  communication is automatically resilient, with exactly-once semantics for
  systems that support idempotency keys, and at-least-once semantics for
  systems that do not.
- **Indefinite Life**. Unless forcibly deleted or failed in a way that is
  unrecoverable (e.g. corruption of memory in a C program), workers live
  forever, without loss of state or progress. This allows workers to be used
  for long-running tasks, such as background processing, or for implementing
  APIs that require long-lived state.
- **Secure Sandboxing**. Workers are executed in completely sandboxed
  environments, with no possibility of workers interacting with each other
  (except via their public APIs), and no possibility that one worker's failure
  impacts another worker's health.

Some of these guarantees are common across all serverless platforms, but others
are unique to the durable computing environment that Golem provides.

# Classic Serverless

Although Golem brings the power of durable computing to serverless, it is still
possible to use Golem as a classic serverless platform.

This enables increased reliability and use of serverless for long-running tasks,
financial transactions, and other use cases that are not well-suited to
traditional serverless platforms.

## Comparing Functions to Workers

|               | Worker | Function | Explanation                                                                                                           |
| :------------ | :----: | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low-Latency   |   ✅   |    ✅    | Functions in serverless environments are designed to execute quickly, making them suitable for low-latency use cases. |
| Scalable      |   ✅   |    ✅    | Functions in serverless environments scale automatically, making them suitable for high-throughput use cases.         |
| Stateful      |   ✅   |    ❌    | Workers are inherently stateful, which means they maintain state for their lifetime, and across repeated invocations. |
| Long-Running  |   ✅   |    ❌    | Workers run indefinitely, without loss of state or progress, making them uniquely suitable for long-running tasks.    |
| Transactional |   ✅   |    ❌    | Workers are executed with strong transactional guarantees, transparently surviving faults, restarts, and updates.     |
| Persistent    |   ✅   |    ❌    | All worker state, including in-memory state, is persistent and survives failures, restarts, and updates without loss. |

## Emulating Classic Serverless

Because Golem supports workers that run forever, each with their own unique
identity, it may not be clear how to use Golem as a classic serverless platform.

To emulate classic serverless, you really only need to do two things:

1. **One-Export Component**. While WASM components can have any number of
   exports, when emulating classic serverless, you should only have one export
   per component. This export represents the event or request handler that you
   would typically have in a classic serverless function.
2. **One Worker Per Request**. When dispatching events or requests to your
   component, you should create a new worker for each event or request. The
   worker will handle the event or request, and never be used again.

To ensure one worker per request or event, you can create a random worker name
for each request or event, and use that to dispatch the event or request to the
worker with the specified identity.

Although the worker will remain available indefinitely, it will only be executed
a single time, when used to handle the event or request. This allows you to
emulate classic serverless behavior, while still benefiting from the durability
and reliability of Golem.

## Operations

Workers support the following operations:

- **Creation**. Workers benefit from automatic creation, which occurs when a
  worker is invoked for the first time. Therefore, it is not necessary to
  create workers explicitly.
- **Interruption**. Workers can be interrupted at any time, which causes the
  worker to stop executing. Interrupted workers can be resumed later.
- **Deletion**. Workers can be deleted, which causes all state of the worker
  to be permanently deleted. Deleted workers cannot be undeleted or resumed,
  and if invoked again, they will be recreated from scratch.
- **Updating**. Workers can be updated to a newer version of a component, which
  is useful for long-lived workers that can benefit from bug fixes or new
  features.

Details about how to perform these operations can be found in the CLI guide,
the REST API reference, and language-specific SDK documentation.
