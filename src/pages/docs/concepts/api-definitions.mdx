# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

As a serverless platform, Golem allows you to deploy components of your
application, without having to write servers or implement protocols like HTTP,
gRPC, or GraphQL.

Without having to write any additional code, Golem provides you with the ability
to trigger the creation of workers from your components based on HTTP API calls.

Although useful for building tooling or quick prototypes, the generic APIs that
Golem gives you to create and interact with your workers are usually not the
polished, engineered APIs that you want to expose to other organizations,
developers of mobile or web applications, or other backend teams.

To allow you to stand up a custom API for your components, Golem supports a
feature called _API Definitions_. API definitions give you the flexibility of
having a precisely engineered API, but without any of the typical boilerplate.

This page contains a high-level introduction to API definitions, with links to
technical reference material.

# API Definitions

In Golem, an API Definition is similar to an OpenAPI specification for an API.
Like OpenAPI specifications, API Definitions contain the following elements:

- **Version**. The version defines the version of the API.
- **Status**. The status defines whether the API is a draft, or whether it is
  published. Currently, published APIs may not be modified.
- **Routes**. The routes are a list of individual HTTP endpoints.

In an API definition, the routes define not just the structure of the overall
HTTP, but also how invocation of these APIs triggers the creation and activation
of workers.

The next section introduces routes in more detail.

## Routes

The elements of a route are as follows:

- **Path**. The path of the route, such as `/users/{user-id}`. Paths may
  contain variables, which may be accessed inside the route binding.
- **Method**. The method of the route, such as GET, PUT, POST, or DELETE.
- **Binding**. The binding defines what worker will be created and invoked
  when the endpoint itself is invoked.

In the following section, you will learn more about the binding.

### Binding

The per-endpoint binding specifies the following elements:

- **Component**. The component to use for the endpoint.
- **Version**. The version of the component to use for the endpoint.
- **Worker**. The worker to invoke when the endpoint itself is invoked.
- **Rib**. A small script that specifies how to adapt the input of the request,
  including the body and headers, to the input of a function on a worker; and
  how to adapt the output of the function to the output of the response,
  including the body and headers.

The script is written in [Rib](/docs/rib), which is a lightweight scripting
languages that has first-class support for WASM component types.

# Management

There are a variety of ways to create and manage API Definition:

- **Golem CLI**. The command-line interface lets you manage API definition.
- **REST API**. The Golem REST API lets you manage API definition

Both the CLI and REST API let you import an existing OpenAPI definition, with
a custom per-endpoint extension that contains the binding.
