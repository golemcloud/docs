# Template Interface

This section describes how your **Golem Template**'s public interface is defined using the **WASM component model** and how is it mapped into the Golem API.

The page is divided into two major sections by tiers, as the ability to define your template's interface is one of the primary differentiators between our different language tiers. Read the [Building Templates](/docs/building-templates) page for more information.

This page will use [Golem CLI](/docs/golem-cli) parameter names when talking about how to invoke functions, but the same rules apply when using the [REST API](/docs/rest-api) too.

## Tier 1 languages

**Tier 1 languages** use the **WASM component model**'s tooling to define their interface using WIT files. Please read the [official design document of the WIT format](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md) to learn what it is capable of.

For each tier 1 language there is a **binding generator** tool that takes the WIT definition and generates the appropriate binding code in the given guest language. Read [Building Templates](/docs/building-templates) for more information about how these tools work.

The WIT definition is also embedded in the compiled WASM that you upload to **Golem**. This is how Golem knows what the exported functions are, and it can validate the provided parameters to make sure they have the correct type.

### Function names

This section explains how you can map the exported function names from your WIT definition to fully qualified names to be passed in the `--function` parameter when invoking an instance.

The component you define has a WIT **package,** specified in the top of your WIT definition.

For example if you generated your code using `golem new` and did not specify a custom package name, it will be:

```rust
package golem:component
```

You can have any other pair of names following the above syntax.

The WIT definition should contain a **single world** (otherwise the world to be used have to be specified for the tools used during compilation). The name of this world does not matter for **Golem** - it won't be part of the function's fully qualified name.

For example it can be:

```rust
world my-component-world {
  // ...
}
```

In this `world` you can either export

- one or more **interface**
- or one or more **functions** directly

The following example demonstrates both:

```rust
package golem:component;

interface api {
  record product-item {
    product-id: string,
    name: string,
    price: float32,
    quantity: u32,
  }

  add-item: func(item: product-item) -> ();
  remove-item: func(product-id: string) -> ();
}

world my-component-world {
  export api;
  export dump: func() -> result<string, string>;
}
```

The name of the interface(s) and function(s) are completely user defined, there are no rules to follow other than the syntax rules of WIT itself.

In the above example we have **3 exported functions** and we can refer to them in the `--function` parameter with the following fully qualified names, consisting of the package name and the exported path:

- `golem:component/api/add-item`
- `golem:component/api/remove-item`
- `golem:component/dump`

#### Resources

WIT specifications also allow the definition of **resources**. These are constructed via special _constructors_, have methods, and can also have associated static functions. Golem supports exporting resources, enabling an alternative of having a separate **worker** for each entity. When exporting resources, a single worker may own an arbitrary number of instances of the exported resource, and the method invocations's first parameter must be the **resource handle** returned by the invoked constructor.

There is a special naming syntax provided by **Golem** that makes it more convenient to invoke resource constructors and methods. Take the following example:

```rust
package golem:component;

interface api {
  resource counter {
    constructor(name: string);
    inc-by: func(value: u64);
    get-value: func() -> u64;

    merge-counters: static func(counter1: counter, counter2: counter, name: string) -> counter;
  }
}

world my-world {
  export api;
}
```

For this WIT specification, the following **function names** are valid when using Golem's invocation API or CLI:

- `golem:component/api/counter/new` - refers to the above defined **constructor**
- `golem:component/api/counter/inc-by`
- `golem:component/api/counter/get-value`
- `golem:component/api/counter/merge-counters`
- `golem:component/api/counter/drop` - special function that drops the instance while the worker continues running

### Parameters and results

This section defines the mapping from the different types you can use or define in your WIT definition and the JSON you pass to the `--parameters` parameter of the invocation and see as your invocation's result.

When invoking a function, the JSON passed to `--parameters` always has to be a **JSON array**. Each element of this array corresponds to one **parameter** of the function. So to call a function without any parameters pass an empty array (`[]`). The result of a function invocation is also a JSON.

The following table maps types you can use in WIT to their JSON encoding:

| WIT type        | JSON type                                                                                                                                                        | Description                                                                   |

## Tier 2 languages

For **Tier 2 languages** you cannot define more than one function to be exported. The function that Golem will run is your program's main function, without passing any arguments or getting any result values.

## Function names

The function name for **tier 2** languages that you need to pass to the `--function` parameter of [Golem CLI](/docs/golem-cli) is always:

- `wasi:cli/run@0.2.0/run`

### Parameters and results

As you cannot define any parameter or result types in **tier 2** the only option is to use **the stdio mode or the stdio event loop mode**.

This is enabled in the [Golem CLI](/docs/golem-cli) using the `--use-stdio` or `--use-stdio-eventloop` commands when invoking an instance.

Once it is enabled, the JSON you pass to the `--parameters` parameter will be directly available to read from the worker's **standard input**, and **Golem** expects the `run` function to write a result JSON to the **standard output**.

No further type checking is performed, but both the input and the output is expected to be JSONs.

When using an **event loop** the worker is expected to run an infinite loop in which each iteration reads a **single line** and parses it as JSON, and outputs a single line JSON as the invocation's results before reading the next one.
