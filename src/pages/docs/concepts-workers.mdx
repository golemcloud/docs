# Introduction 

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

In server-based programming, the fundamental unit of work is the _server_, which 
accepts incoming connections, and handles requests by generating responses. 

In Golem, which is a serverless computing platform, the fundamental unit of 
work is the _worker_. A worker is a _running instance_ of a component, with a 
unique identity, which allows addressing specific workers. 

Workers are similar to _lambdas_ or _functions_ in other serverless computing 
platforms, but they are far more powerful and expressive.

<Callout type="info">
  The relationship between a component and a worker is the same as the 
  relationship between an executable and a process: processes are 
  running instances of executables. While the executable contains 
  mostly code, which awaits execution, a process contains both code, 
  as well as state, which captures work-in-progress.

In the next section, core elements of workers are discussed in more detail.

# Worker Essentials

The fundamental elements of every worker include:

 - **Identity**. Every worker has a unique identity, which allows addressing 
   specific workers.
 - **State**. Every worker has state, including memory, environment variables, 
   and file system.
 - **API**. Every worker has a public API, defined by its component.

These elements are discussed in the sections that follow.

## Identity

Every worker has a globally unique identity, which is formed from the 
following elements:

 - **Component ID**. Every component deployed on Golem has a globally 
   unique identity (UUID), which is assigned by Golem when a new component 
   is uploaded to Golem.
 - **Worker Name**. The worker name can be chosen by you for each worker. 
   If you do not need to address workers specifically, you can also use 
   a UUID for the worker name. The only constraint is that worker names 
   must be unique within the scope of a component.

The unique identity of workers allows them to be addressed individually, 
which unlocks many powerful patterns for building distributed systems.

## State

Workers are inherently stateful, in the same way that any running process 
is stateful.

Workers have the following stateful elements:

 - **Memory**. A worker has in-memory state, such as global variables, stack, 
   and so on, which constantly changes over the life of the worker.
 - **Environment Variables**. A worker has environment variables, which it 
   inherits from component settings, and which may change over time.
 - **File System**. A worker has a file system, which it inherits from 
   component settings, but which may evolve over the life of the worker.
 - **Status**. The status of the worker, managed by Golem, is one of the 
   following: running, idle, suspended, interrupted, retrying, failed, or exited.

State also includes something called the _instruction pointer_, which
is not accessible in most programming languages, but which tracks
which location in the code the CPU is currently executing.

## API 

Workers are running instances of components. Because components have a 
public API, which is defined by WIT, workers inherit this API.

To perform work, such as handling a request, you _invoke_ a worker's 
public API. This process is referred to as _invocation_, and you can 
learn more in the section on [invocation](#concepts-invocation).
