# Projects

Here in the console, every project is more than just a collection of files and settingsâ€”it's a comprehensive environment equipped for the full lifecycle of serverless application development.

## Project Essentials

Projects in Golem Cloud provide a focused setting for your development, where you can access and manage all the critical components of your application:

- **Templates**: Reusable WebAssembly programs are the foundation for your cloud services
- **Workers**: Workers are the dynamic, executable instances of your templates with baked in durability
- **API Gateway**: Build scalable APIs to expose your workers to the world
- **Users**: Collaborate with your team, granting custom access to align with roles and responsibilities.

The diagram below shows how these parts work together in a project:

    direction TB
    class Project {
        Template []
        ApiGateway []
        User []
    }
    class Template {
        WASM Binary
        version
    }
    class ApiGateway {
        Route[]
    }
    class User {
        username
        permissions
    }
    class Worker {
        Wasm Interface Type Exports
    }
    class Route {
        HTTP Method
        HTTP Path
        Expression Mappings
    }

    Project --> Template
    Project --> ApiGateway
    Project --> User
    Template --> Worker
    ApiGateway --> Route : consists of
    Route --> Worker : binds to
```
