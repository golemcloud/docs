# Working with Golem Promises in JavaScript

Golem **promises** provide a way for Golem workers to wait on an external condition. The worker creates the promise and somehow sends its identifier to the external system responsible for **completing** the promise. Then the worker can **await** the promise, being suspended until the external system completes the promise using Golem's REST API.

It is also possible to complete a promise from within a Golem worker using the Golem SDK.

When a promise is completed, an arbitrary byte array can be attached to it as a payload - this data is returned to the awaiting worker when is continues execution.

In JavaScript the promise API has idiomatic JavaScript wrappers in the [Golem JavaScript SDK](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/golem-js-sdk.mdx).

### Creating a promise

To create a promise simply call the `createPromise` function:

```javascript
import { createPromise, PromiseId } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

const promiseId = createPromise()
```

The returned value has the following shape:

```javascript
// A promise ID is a value that can be passed to an external Golem API to complete that promise
// from an arbitrary external source, while Golem workers can await for this completion.
const promiseId = {
  // Represents the worker
  workerId: {
    // Represents the component
    componentId: {
      uuid: {
        highBits: BigInt(0),
        lowBits: BigInt(0),
      },
    },
    workerName: "worker-name",
  },
  oplogIdx: BigInt(0),
}
```

### Deleting a promise

If a promise is no longer used, it has to be deleted with:

```javascript
import { deletePromise } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

deletePromise(promiseId)
```

### Awaiting a promise

To await a promise, use the `awaitPromise` functions, which returns the promise result as a byte array payload.
Here's an example that awaits a promise, then decodes the payload from JSON format:

```javascript
import { awaitPromise } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

const byteArrayPayload = awaitPromise(promiseId) // returns Uint8Array;
const payload = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(byteArrayPayload))
```

### Completing a promise from within a worker

To complete a promise from within a worker, use the `completePromise` function.
The following example completes a promise with a value encoded as JSON:

```javascript
import { completePromise } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

const payload = {
  id: "value",
  meta: "data",
}
const byteArrayPayload = new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(payload)) // create Uint8Array payload;
const success = completePromise(promiseId, byteArrayPayload) // returns boolean;
```

### Completing a promise from an external source

To see how to use the **promise ID** to complete a promise through the external REST API, check [the REST API documentation](../../../docs/rest-api.mdx).
