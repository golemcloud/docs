# High level transactions in JavaScript

On top of the [durability controls](/docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/durability) and [retry controls](/docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/retries), the [golem-ts](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-ts) library also provides a high level functions for defining transactions supporting **compensation actions** in case of getting reverted.

Although Golem's automatic retry policies and low level atomic regions provide a lot of power automatically, many times a set of external operations such as HTTP requests needs to be executed **transactionally**; if one of the operations fails, the whole transaction need to be rolled back by executing some compensation actions.

The `golem-ts` library provides support for two different types of transactions:

- **fallible transactions** are only dealing with domain errors
- **infallible transactions** must always succeed, and Golem applies its active retry policy to it

### Fallible transactions

Many times external operations (such as HTTP calls to remote hosts) need to be executed transactionally. If some of the operations failed the transaction need to be rolled back - compensation actions need to undo whatever the already successfully performed operations did.

A **fallible transaction** only deals with domain errors. Within the transaction every operation that succeeds gets recorded. If an operation fails, all the recorded operations get compensated in reverse order before the transaction block returns with a failure.

A fallible transaction can be executed using the `fallibleTransaction` function, by passing a closure that can execute operations on the open transaction (see below).

### Infallible transactions

An infallible transaction must always succeed - in case of a failure or interruption, it gets retried. If there is a domain error, the compensation actions are executed before the retry.

An infallible transaction can be executed using the `infallibleTransaction` function, by passing a closure that can execute **operations** on the open transaction (see below).

### Operations

Both transaction types require the definition of **operations**.

As documentation, here is the _TypeScript_ interface that operations has to match:

```typescript
/**
 * Represents an atomic operation of the transaction which has a rollback action.
 *
 * Implement this interface and use it within a `transaction` block.
 * Operations can also be constructed from closures using `operation`.
 */
export interface Operation<In, Out, Err> {
  /**
   * The action to execute.
   * @param input - The input to the operation.
   * @returns The result of the operation.
   */
  execute(input: In): Result<Out, Err>
  /**
   * Compensation to perform in case of failure.
   * Compensations should not throw errors.
   * @param input - The input to the operation.
   * @param result - The result of the operation.
   * @returns The result of the compensation.
   */
  compensate(input: In, result: Out): Result<void, Err>
}
```

In _JavaScript_ there are two ways to define an operation that matches the above interface:

1. Implement the `Operation` interface manually

```javascript
const op = {
  execute(input) {
    // execute operation, then return success
    return Result.ok({ id: "value" })
    // or error
    // return Result.err("error");
  },
  compensate(input, result) {
    // revert operation, then return success
    return Result.unit()
    // or error
    // return Result.err("error");
  },
}
```

2. Use the `operation` function to create an operation from a pair of closures

```javascript
const op = operation(
  input => {
    // execute operation, then return success
    return Result.ok({ id: "value" })
    // or error
    // return Result.err("error");
  },
  (input, result) => {
    return Result.unit()
    // or error
    // return Result.err("error");
  }
)
```

### Executing operations

The defined operations can be executed in _fallible_ or _infallible_ mode:

```javascript
import { fallibleTransaction, infallibleTransaction, operation, Result } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

// example operation with compensation
const op = operation(
  idx => {
    // the operation / side effect
    return Result.ok("id-" + idx)
  },
  (id, idx) => {
    // compensation
    console.log(`reverting ${id}, ${idx}`)
    return Result.unit()
  }
)

// with fallibleTransaction errors have to be handled and propagated using the Result type
const resultFallible = fallibleTransaction(tx => {
  return tx
    .execute(op, 1)
    .flatMap(firstId => tx.execute(op, 2).map(secondId => [firstId, secondId]))
})

// with infallibleTransaction no explicit error handling is needed, as it is handled by Golem retries
const resultInfallible = infallibleTransaction(tx => {
  const firstId = tx.execute(op, 1)
  const secondId = tx.execute(op, 1)
  return [firstId, secondId]
})
```
