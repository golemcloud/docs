# Next steps

After [setting up the JavaScript development environment](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/setup.mdx) and learning the basic steps [writing a Golem component](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/defining-components.mdx) and [building them](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/building-components.mdx), please consider learning about the following topics:

<Steps>
### Making HTTP requests from a Golem component
Learn how to [send HTTP requests from a Golem component written in JavaScript](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/http.mdx).

### Control durability guarantees

Check how the JavaScript Golem SDK can [control various durability settings](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/durability.mdx) of Golem.

### Automatic retries

Learn about Golem's retry mechanism and [how it can be customized](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/retries.mdx).

### Transactions

Use the higher level [transactions library](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/transactions.mdx) to implement the _Saga pattern_.

### Promises

Create and use [promises](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/promises.mdx) to await external events from within a running worker.

### Using WASI interfaces

See what low-level [WASI interfaces](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/wasi.mdx) are available and how they can be used from JavaScript.

### Call other workers from a worker

[Worker to Worker communication](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/rpc.mdx)
