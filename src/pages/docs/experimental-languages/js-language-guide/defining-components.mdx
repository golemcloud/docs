# Defining Golem Components in JavaScript

## Creating a project

Using Golem's **command line interface** provides a set of predefined, Golem-specific **examples** to choose from as a starting point.

To see the available examples for JavaScript, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli list-examples --language js
```

<Callout type="info">
  The set of examples provided by Golem CLI is defined in the open-source repository
  [golem-examples](http://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples).
</Callout>

Then to create a new project based on the default JavaScript example, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli new --language js --package-name 'golem:demo' js-example
```

The command will create a new Golem project in the `js-example` directory, and print short, language-specific instructions on how to build the project.

## Specification-first approach

Golem and the JavaScript toolchain currently requires defining the component's interface using the **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** format. See [the official documentation of this format](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) for reference.

Each new project generated with `golem-cli` contains a `wit` directory with at least one `.wit` file defining a `world`. This world can contain **exports** (exported functions and interfaces) and these exports will be the compiled Golem component's public API.

To **implement** the specification written in WIT, the JavaScript code must implement these interfaces and export them in `main.js`.

### Exporting top-level functions

WIT allows exporting one or more top-level functions in the `world` section, for example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

world example {
    export hello-world: func() -> string;
}
```

To implement this function in JavaScript we simply have to export a function with matching names and types in `main.js`:

```javascript
export function helloWorld(): string {
  return "hello";
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that in WIT, identifiers are using the `kebab-case` naming convention, while JavaScript uses
  the `PascalCase` and `camelCase` convention. The generated bindings map between these are handled
  automatically.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
During [componentization](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/golem-js-sdk.mdx) the exported objects and functions are checked against the `wit` world, eg. if the helloWorld function were not exported, we would get the following error:

```
(jco componentize) ComponentError: Expected a JS export definition for 'helloWorld'
```

</Callout>

### Exporting interfaces

WIT supports defining and exporting whole _interfaces_, coupling together multiple functions and possibly custom data types.

Take the following example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  add: func(value: u64);
  get: func() -> u64;
}

world example {
  export api;
}
```

This is similar to having the two exported functions directly exported from the `world` section, but now a matching JavaScript object needs to be exported:

```javascript
let state = BigInt(0)

export const api = {
  add(value) {
    console.log(`Adding ${value} to the counter`)
    state += value
  },
  get() {
    return state
  },
}
```

<Callout type="info">
    During [componentization](../../../docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/golem-js-sdk.mdx) the exported objects and functions are checked against the `wit` world, eg. if the get function were not part of the `api` objects, we would get an error similar to this:

    ```
    Exception while pre-initializing: (new Error(main.js source does not export a golem:component/api get function as expected by the world.
    Try defining it on the interface alias api:
        export const api = {
            get () {}
        };,
        "main.bindings.js", 73))
    ```

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  components, which is required to implement these two functions.
</Callout>

### Exporting resources

The `WIT` format supports defining and exporting **resources** - entities defined by their constructor function and the available methods on them.

Golem supports exporting these resources as part of the worker's API.

The following example modifies the previously seen _counter_ example to define it as a resource, getting the counter's name as a constructor parameter:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  resource counter {
    constructor(name: string);
    add: func(value: u64);
    get: func() -> u64;
  }
}

world example {
  export api;
}
```

Resources can have multiple instances within a worker. Their constructor returns a _handle_ which is then used to call the methods on the resource. Learn more about how resources can be implicitly created and invoked through Golem's APIs in the [Invocations page](../../../docs/concepts/invocations.mdx).

To implement the above defined WIT resource in JavaScript a few new steps must be taken:

- define a class representing the resource - it can contain data!
- implement the interface generated as the resource's interface for this class named `CounterInstance`
- implement the constructor on the component class as defined by the interface `CounterStatic`

Let's see in code:

```javascript
class Counter {
  name
  state = BigInt(0)

  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name
  }

  add(value) {
    this.state += value
  }

  get() {
    return this.state
  }
}

export const api = {
  Counter: Counter,
}
```

### Data types defined in WIT

The `WIT` specifications contains some primitive and higher level data types and also allows defining custom data types which can be used as function parameters and return values on the exported functions, interfaces and resources.

The following table shows an example of each `WIT` data type and its corresponding Javascript type:

| WIT Type                             | Javascript Type          | Notes                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| bool                                 | boolean                  |                                                                |
| u8, s8, u16, s16, u32, s32, f32, f64 | number                   |                                                                |
| u64, s64                             | bigint                   |                                                                |
| char                                 | string                   | Represents a single Unicode character                          |
| string                               | string                   |                                                                |
| list\<T>                             | T[]                      | For most types                                                 |
| list\<u8>                            | Uint8Array               | Special case for byte arrays                                   |
| tuple\<T1, T2, ...>                  | [T1, T2, ...]            |                                                                |
| record                               | interface                | Fields become properties                                       |
| variant                              | union of interfaces      | Each case becomes an interface with a `tag` and optional `val` |
| enum                                 | union of string literals |                                                                |
| option\<T>                           | T \| null                | If T can be represented as null                                |
| option\<T>                           | Option\<T>               | If T cannot be represented as null                             |
| result\<T, E>                        | Result\<T, E>            |                                                                |
| result\<\_, string>                  | Result\<void, string>    |                                                                |
| flags                                | interface                | Each flag becomes an optional boolean property                 |
| resource                             | class                    | Methods become class methods                                   |

The `Result` type above is expected to be a discriminated union:

```javascript
const okResult = { tag: "ok", val: "hello" }
const errorResult = { tag: "err", val: "error" }
```

### WIT records

The following WIT record type:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
    record user {
        id: u64,
        name: string,
    }
}
```

Will expect the following JavaScript object:

```javascript
const user = {
  id: BigInt(1),
  name: "name",
}
```

### WIT variants

The following WIT variant type:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
    variant color {
        red,
        green,
        blue,
        rgb(string)
    }
}
```

Will expect a JavaScript tagged union:

```JavaScript
const colorRed = {"tag": "red"};
const colorRgb = {"tag": "rgb", val: "#ff00ff"};
```

### WIT enums

The following WIT enum type:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
    enum color {
        red,
        green,
        blue
    }
}
```

Will expect a JavaScript string matching the above enum cases:

```JavaScript
const color = "green";
```

### WIT flags

The following WIT flags type:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
    flags access {
        read,
        write,
        lst
    }
}
```

Will expect a JavaScript object:

```javascript
const access = {
  read: true,
  write: false,
  // some of the flags can be omitted, like `lst` in this example
}
```

## Worker configuration

It is often required to pass _configuration values_ to workers when they are started.

In general Golem supports three different ways of doing this:

1. Defining a list of string arguments passed to the worker, available as **command line arguments**
2. Defining a list of key-value pairs passed to the worker, available as **environment variables**.
3. Using **resource constructors** to pass configuration values to the worker.

### Command line arguments and environment variables

Command line arguments and environment variables are accessible through the generated bindings:

```javascript
import { getArguments, getEnvironment } from "wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0"

const args = getArguments() // returns []string
const env = getEnvironment() // returns [string, string][]
```

Environment variables can be specified when a worker is **explicitly created**, but there are some environment variables that are always set by Golem:

- `GOLEM_WORKER_NAME` - the name of the worker
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_ID` - the ID of the worker's component
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_VERSION` - the version of the component used for this worker

In addition to these, when using [Worker to Worker communication](rpc.mdx), workers created by remote calls **inherit the environment variables of the caller**.

This feature makes environment variables a good fit for passing configuration such as hostnames, ports, or access tokens to trees of workers.

### Resource constructors

As explained earlier, Golem workers can export **resources** and these resources can have **constructor parameters**.

Although resources can be used in many ways, one pattern for Golem is only create a single instance of the exported resource in each worker, and use it to pass configuration values to the worker. This is supported by Golem's worker invocation syntax directly, allowing to implicitly create workers and the corresponding resource by a single invocation as described on the [Invocations page](../../../docs/concepts/invocations.mdx).

## Managing state

Golem workers are **stateful**. There are two major techniques to store and manipulate state in a Golem worker implemented in JavaScript:

1. Using a global variable
2. Using **resources** and storing state in the resource's class

All techniques were demonstrated above in the code examples.
