## Setup development environment for JavaScript

First install **Node.js** and **npm** to your system by following the official [instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

Typescript programs can be compiled into WASM components using the `componentize-js` and `jco` npm packages. For **Golem** you should use our forked version of these tools, as they pin all the dependencies to the ones required by Golem Cloud, and they also include workarounds for some experimental features.

These tools are using the [StarlingMonkey](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/) JavaScript engine to create WASM components from JavaScript.

The tool packages can be installed globally, but we recommend adding them to your `package.json`.

Projects created with `golem-cli new` will reference the latest versions of the appropriate forked tools.

In case you want setup you project manually, see the steps for using the [Golem JavaScript SDK](/docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/golem-js-sdk).

## Install WebAssembly tooling for Worker to Worker communication

Using [Worker to Worker communication](/docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/rpc) requires **Rust** and **WASM** tooling, because _golem RPC client stubs_ are generated and implemented as _Rust_ components.

<Steps>

### Install Rust

Install rustup

```bash copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Install the latest stable version of Rust

```bash copy
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
```

Add the WASI target

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

### Install `cargo-component`

The last step is installing the `cargo-component` extension for Rust's `cargo` build tool. This will enable a set of subcommands for `cargo` which allows compiling Rust projects into **WebAssembly components**.

Install the version `0.13.2` of `cargo-component` with `cargo` itself:

```shell
$ cargo install --force --locked cargo-component@0.13.2
```

Verify that the correct version is installed:

```shell
$ cargo component --version
cargo-component 0.13.2 (wasi:040ec92)
```

Please refer [to the cargo-component website](http://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component) for more information.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Golem requires a **specific version** of `cargo-component`. Please make sure the correct version
  is installed with the commands described above.
