# Using WASI interfaces from JavaScript

Golem implements and exports a subset of the [WASI](https://wasi.dev) interfaces, as well as its own **runtime interfaces**.

The [Golem JavaScript SDK](/docs/experimental-languages/js-language-guide/golem-js-sdk) provides idiomatic wrappers on a subset of these interfaces, but it is also possible to use the generated bindings directly.

## WIT specifications

The full set of WIT specifications Golem implements is available in the following public repository:
