# Defining Golem Components in Zig

## Creating a project

Golem's **command line interface** provides a set of predefined, Golem-specific **examples** to choose from as a starting point.

To see the available examples for Zig, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli list-examples --language zig
```

<Callout type="info">
  The set of examples provided by Golem CLI is defined in the open-source repository
  [golem-examples](http://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples).
</Callout>

Then to create a new project based on one the default Zig example, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli new --language zig --package-name 'golem:demo' example
```

The command will create a new Golem project in the `example` directory, and print short, language-specific instructions on how to build the project.

## Specification-first approach

Golem and the Zig (and C/C++) toolchain currently requires defining the component's interface using the **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** format. See [the official documentation of this format](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) for reference.

Each new project generated with `golem-cli` contains a `wit` directory with at least one `.wit` file defining a `world`. This world can contain **exports** (exported functions and interfaces) and these exports will be the compiled Golem component's public API.

The first time a component is compiled (see the [Building Components page](/docs/experimental-languages/zig-language-guide/building-components) for details), a couple of files (`example.c`, `example.h` and `example_component_type.o` if the component name was `example`) get generated in the `src/bindings` directory. This module contains the C definitions of all the data types and interfaces defined in the `WIT` file(s).

To **implement** the specification written in WIT, the Zig code must implement some of these generated exported functions defined in the generated header file.

As currently there is no Zig-specific binding generator, for more details, check the [C/C++ guide for defining components](/docs/ccpp-language-guide/defining-components).
