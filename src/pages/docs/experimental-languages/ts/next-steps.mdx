# Next steps

After [setting up the TypeScript development environment](/docs/ts-language-guide/setup) and learning the basic steps [writing a Golem component](/docs/ts-language-guide/defining-components) and [building them](/docs/ts-language-guide/building-components), please consider learning about the following topics:

<Steps>
### Making HTTP requests from a Golem component
Learn how to [send HTTP requests from a Golem component written in TypeScript](/docs/ts-language-guide/http).
