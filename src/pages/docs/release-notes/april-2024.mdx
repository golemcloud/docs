# Breaking changes April 2024

Several breaking changes are being applied as a preparation of the 1.0 version.

We reverted the change introduced in [August of 2023](/docs/release-notes/august-2023) and now Golem **templates** are called **components** again, to be better aligned with the rest of the WebAssembly ecosystem.

New persistence features changed the serialization format used by Golem in a non backward compatible way. Note that this will not happen after the first stable release.

New features are being added to Golem's _runtime API_ which requires updating Golem's WIT definitions in the user components that are using them.
