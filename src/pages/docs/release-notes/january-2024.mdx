# Breaking changes Janury 2024

The **Golem Cloud Janury 2024 release** contains a couple of breaking changes requiring installation of new tooling and rebuilding/re-uploading the user's projects, as it's core WASM engine was updated to the latest version.

## REST API changes
We made some small changes to the REST API, and changed its version to `v2`. All the endpoints are now under the `/v2` path, and the `v1` endpoints are no longer available.

We provide an OpenAPI specification for the new API now.

## Update to the latest WASI and component model versions
The new versions are using an updated version of the WASM Component Model and
it's WIT interface definition language, introducing the concept of _resources_.

The WASI interface definitions had breaking changes since the version implemented in earlier Golem Cloud versions, having the following consequences:

- The **required versions of** tooling (depending on the guest language) has been changed. Make sure to install the new versions before compiling any template for Golem Cloud!
- The existing templates **cannot run** on the updated version of Golem Cloud. They need to be recompiled with the new tooling.
- There are some differences in the generated bindings / required settings etc, depending on the used guest language, so the template's source code may have to be updated before recompilation. These differences are collected below.

### Common changes
The WIT format has been changed, now it requires _semicolons_ at the end of definitions, and it allows to define _resources_. The latest version of the format is documented [in the official component model repository](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md).

The WASI interfaces has been updated as well, they are now taking advantage of the resource support and some definitions were moved around / changed. If you were directly using any of the WASI interfaces, please check the updated definitions in the [golem-wit](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/jan-2024-release) repository.

New templates generated with the latest version of `golem-cli` will contain the updated definitions.

Guest languages which are using `wasm-tools` to wrap the WASM module into a WASM component need a new version of `wasm-tools` and the Preview2 adapters.

The required `wasm-tools` version is 1.0.54:

```bash
cargo install  --force --locked wasm-tools@1.0.54
```

The new tier2 and tier3 adapters are in the [golem-wit](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/jan-2024-release) repository.

### Rust specific changes
The primary source level change is to update the `cargo-component-bindings` dependency to `0.5.0`:

```toml
[dependencies]
cargo-component-bindings = { version = "0.5.0" }
```

If you are using our `reqwest` fork for HTTP requests, you need to update it to the `update-jan-2024` branch:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { git = "https://github.com/zivergetech/reqwest", branch = "update-jan-2024", features = ["json"] }
```

Beside that you need to update `cargo-component` itself to `0.5.0` as well:

```bash
cargo install --force --locked cargo-component@0.5.0
```

### Javascript and Scala.JS specific changes
The `package.json` file needs to be updated to use the updated version of the `jco` and `componentize-js`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@bytecodealliance/jco": "0.14.1",
    "@bytecodealliance/componentize-js": "0.5.0"
  },
}
```

### Python specific changes
The version of `componentize-py` (`0.7.1`) must be downloaded from https://github.com/golemcloud/componentize-py/releases/tag/untagged-860415915cbad37073cb

### Go specific changes
A new compiler flag is needed when using the latest TinyGo version (`0.30.0`), when using the HTTP client: `-tags=purego`.

The `wit-bindgen` tool needs to be updated to a specific revision:

```bash
cargo install wit-bindgen-cli --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen --force --rev 3433f2d8515dd9eba95fd3ad581f5c389ae9dd1f
```

The `roundtrip.go` HTTP client implementation needs to be updated, the latest code can be found at https://github.com/golemcloud/go-wasi-http/tree/v0.2.0.

### C specific changes
The `wit-bindgen` tool needs to be updated to a specific revision:

```bash
cargo install wit-bindgen-cli --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen --force --rev 3433f2d8515dd9eba95fd3ad581f5c389ae9dd1f
```

This new version requires a new parameter that decides wheter to automatically drop resources in the generated bindings:

```bash
wit-bindgen c --autodrop-borrows yes ./wit
```
