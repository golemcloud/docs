# Operate - metadata

Services are using following types of storage:

- Relational Database (RDB) - [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or SQLite (mainly for testing purposes)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- File/Blob storage - Shared File System or S3

### Component Service

Service is using RDB and File/Blob storage as data storage.

RDB tables:

| Table                | Description                                                    |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `components`         | Components data - id, name                                     |
| `component_versions` | Version specific components data - version, component metadata |

See [RDB migrations](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/main/golem-component-service/db/migration) for more details.

File/Blob storage is used to store [components](concepts-components.mdx) binary data.

### Worker Service

Service is using RDB as data storage.

RDB tables:

| Table             | Description          |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `api_definitions` | API definitions data |
| `api_deployments` | API deployments data |

See [RDB migrations](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/main/golem-worker-service/db/migration) for more details.

### Shard Manager

Service is using Redis as data storage. Redis is used to store shard assignments.
Shard assignments are stored in one record with key `shard:shard_manager_state`.

### Component Compilation Service

Service is using File/Blob storage as data storage.

### Worker Executor

See the [persistence](operate-persistence) page for more details about how the worker state get persisted.
