# Components

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy 
highly reliable distributed systems.

Golem provides transparent durability to applications by completely taking over 
code execution. Rather than executing machine code, which would result in 
highly degraded performance, Golem executes code that has been compiled to 
WebAssembly.

WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction set for a stack-based virtual machine 
that can be run on almost every platform and device. WASM is designed to be a 
portable, cross-language target for compilers and interpreters.

Golem has a custom executor that executes WASM code durably, by performing 
real-time state replication across multiple nodes. Combined with supervision 
and automatic recovery, this allows Golem to execute code transactionally, 
impervious to faults, restarts, and updates.

The WASM standard by itself does not provide any built-in I/O capabilities or 
ystem interfaces, making it insufficient for real-world applications. To 
address this fundamental gap, Golem adopts and fully supports the WebAssembly 
component model.

The component model serves as the foundation for WASI (WebAssembly System 
Interface), which provides crucial OS-like functionality to WASM modules. WASI 
defines a standardized set of system interfaces, allowing WebAssembly programs 
to perform essential operations such as file I/O, network access, and time m
anagement.

For Golem, this means that components can interact with the underlying system 
in a consistent and portable manner, regardless of the host environment.

Languages that support WASM use WASI (through the component model) to provide 
the functionality baked into their standard libraries, which are in turn used 
to build libraries and frameworks that developers use to build applications.

By embracing the component model and WASI, Golem enables your WASM-based 
applications to benefit from the full capabilities of the underlying system, 
while also ensuring security and portability.

As an added benefit, the component model also facilitates cross-language 
interoperability, further extending Golem's flexibility as a development 
platform, and enabling polyglot development without having to go through 
bulky and slow protocols like HTTP or gRPC.

In this document, we will focus on the Golem-specific aspects of the component 
model, and provide instructions for working with components on Golem.
