# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

Golem provides transparent durability to applications by taking over 
execution of code. However, for performance and portability reasons, Golem does
not execute machine code. Rather Golem executes code that has been compiled to 
_WebAssembly_.

WebAssembly (_WASM_) is a binary instruction set for a stack-based virtual 
machine that can be run on any platform and device. WASM is designed to be 
a portable, cross-language target for compilers and interpreters.

Golem has a custom executor that executes WASM code durably, by performing
real-time state replication across multiple nodes. Combined with supervision
and automatic recovery, this allows Golem to execute code transactionally,
impervious to faults, restarts, and updates.

The WASM standard by itself does not provide any built-in I/O capabilities or
ystem interfaces, making it insufficient for real-world applications. To
address this fundamental gap, Golem adopts and fully supports the WebAssembly
component model.

The component model serves as the foundation for WASI (WebAssembly System 
Interface), which provides crucial OS-like functionality to WASM modules. WASI 
defines a standardized set of system interfaces, allowing WebAssembly programs 
to perform essential operations such as file I/O, network access, and time 
management.

For Golem, this means that components can interact with the underlying system
in a consistent and portable manner, regardless of the host environment.

Languages that support WASM use WASI (through the component model) to provide 
the functionality built into their standard libraries, which are in turn used 
to build libraries and frameworks that developers use to build applications.

By embracing the component model and WASI, Golem enables your WASM-based
applications to benefit from the full capabilities of the underlying system,
while also ensuring security and portability.

As an added benefit, the component model also facilitates cross-language
interoperability, further extending Golem's flexibility as a development
platform, and enabling polyglot development without having to go through
bulky and slow protocols like HTTP or gRPC.

In this document, we will focus on the Golem-specific aspects of the component 
model, and provide high-level overview of working with components.

# Basics 

WASM components have a well-defined structure, which facilitates their execution
in a host environment, as well as their interaction with other components.

The high-level structure of a WASM component is as follows:

 - **Code**. The code section of a WASM component contains the WebAssembly 
   bytecode that implements the component's functionality.
 - **Data**. The data section of a WASM component contains all static data 
   that the component requires at runtime, such as constant strings.
 - **Imports**. The import section of a WASM component contains a list of 
   imports that the component requires from other components or the host 
   environment.
 - **Exports**. The export section of a WASM component contains a list of 
   exports that the component provides to other components or to the host 
   environment. 

In order to be executed, a WASM component must be provided with all of its
dependencies, which are defined in the import section. The host environment
then provides the actual implementations for these imports.

Typically, these dependencies are WASI imports, which define the low-level,
OS-like functionality that the component requires to function. For example,
a component that needs to read from a file might import a WASI import for
file I/O.

<Callout type="info">
  Developers of WASM components do not typically have to know about or 
  interact with WASI directly, because the standard library for their 
  language of choice will be implemented in terms of WASI. In turn, 
  frameworks and libraries that developers use are implemented in terms 
  of the standard library, hiding details of WASI from developers.
</Callout>

WASM components bear some similarities to machine-code executables, but they 
are much richer:

A machine-code executable interacts directly with the operating system, and
has only a single entry point, the main function. WASM components, on the other
hand, must be passed capabilities explicitly from the host environment, and
they can export many different functions, which can be called by the host
environment or by other components.

Thus, conceptually, WASM components are much closer to _libraries_, such as 
shared libraries that can be used by multiple executables, rather than 
executables themselves.

# Development

Development of WASM components requires language-specific support, including:

- A compiler that can compile the language to WASM; or, for interpreted 
  languages, an interpreter that can be compiled to WASM.
- A standard library that is implemented in terms of WASI, and that provides
  the functionality that the language requires to operate, such as I/O.
- Support for importing and exporting functions, so that components 
  developed in the language can interact with the host environment, 
  and with other components.

However, there are some concepts and aspects of developing WASM components 
that are language-independent, and relevant to all developers working with 
components on Golem.

## Lifecycle

The lifecycle for developing a WASM component typically involves the following
steps:

1. **Dependencies**. Identify the dependencies that the component requires, 
   including dependencies such as WASI that are required by the language's 
   standard library.
2. **Interface**. Define the public interface of the component, which includes 
   both types and functions. In serverless environments like Golem, the interface 
   dictates how external systems may interact with the component.
3. **Implementation**. Implement the component's functionality, including 
   satisfying the public interface of the component, using the language's 
   standard library and any other dependencies that are required.
4. **Building**. Using language-specific tools, compile the implementation of 
   the component to a WASM component; or, for interpreted languages, package 
   the code into a WASM component, typically by bundling the interpreter.

Both steps (1) and (2) are heavily dependent on WebAssembly Interface Type 
(WIT), a language-independent interface description language (IDL) that is used
to describe both dependencies and interface of components.

The following section provides a brief introduction to WIT.

## WIT

_Wasm Interface Type_ (WIT) is a language-independent interface description
language (IDL) that is used both to describe the dependencies of a component,
and to describe the interface of a component.

WIT can be compared to protocol buffers (protobuf), but there are 
a number of distinctions:

1. Unlike protobuf, WIT is used to describe the dependencies of components;
2. WIT is designed specifically for WASM components;
3. WIT operates at a lower-level than protobuf, enabling cross-language 
interoperability&mdash;for example, a Javascript component calling into a 
C/C++ component.

It is beyond the scope of this document to provide a full introduction to WIT,
but the following list introduces some key concepts:

- **Worlds**. A world contains both imports and exports, describing both 
  required dependencies, and provided functionality.
- **Types**. WIT supports a number of primitive types, including integers, 
  floats, and strings, as well as compound types such as records and lists.
- **Functions**. WIT supports the definition of functions, including their
  arguments and return types. Functions can be defined as part of an interface,
  and may be organized into packages.
- **Resources**. A _resource_ is a special type used for representing values 
  that exist in one component (or the host environment) and accessed elsewhere.

The following example shows a simple WIT interface that defines a function
`add` that takes two integers and returns an integer:

```
package adder;

interface math {
  add: func(a: s32, b: s32) -> s32;
}
```

An analogous protobuf definition for this interface would be:

```
syntax = "proto3";

package adder;

service Math {
  rpc Add(AddRequest) returns (AddResponse);
}

message AddRequest {
  int32 a = 1;
  int32 b = 2;
}

message AddResponse {
  int32 result = 1;
}
```

Further information on WIT can be found in [official documentation](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html),
as well as the [WIT specification](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/blob/main/design/mvp/WIT.md).

# Language-Agnostic Tooling 

Although the exact toolchain used to build a WASM component will depend on the
language being used, there are a number of language-agnostic tools that are
useful for working with WASM components.

In this section, you will learn about these tools.

## wasm-tools 

The Bytecode Alliance provides a set of tools for working with WASM components,
called `wasm-tools`. This command-line interface (CLI) provides a number of 
related commands for working with WASM components, including:

- `validate`. Validate a WebAssembly file.
- `parse`. Translate the WebAssembly text format to binary.
- `print`. Translate the WebAssembly binary format to text.
- `smith`. Generate a valid WebAssembly module from an input seed.
- `mutate`. Mutate an input WASM file into a new valid WASM file.
- `shrink`. Shrink a WASM file while preserving a predicate.
- `dump`. Print debugging information about the binary format.
- `objdump`. Print debugging information about section headers.
- `strip`. Remove custom sections from a WebAssembly file.
- `demangle`. Demangle Rust and C++ symbol names in the name section.
- `compose`. Compose WASM components together (deprecated).
- `component new`. Create a component from a core WASM binary.
- `component wit`. Extract a `*.wit` interface from a component.
- `component embed`. Embed a component-type custom section in a core WASM binary.
- `metadata show`. Show name and producer metadata in a component or module.
- `metadata add`. Add name or producer metadata to a component or module.
- `addr2line`. Translate WASM offsets to filename/line numbers with DWARF.
- `completion`. Generate shell completion scripts for `wasm-tools`.
- `json-from-wast`. Convert a `*.wast` file into JSON commands.

One of the most useful commands is `component new`, which provides the ability
to create a WASM component from a core WASM binary. This is useful for language 
ecosystems that do not yet have a native way to produce WASM components, but 
which can produce WASM modules.

You can download precompiled artifacts for wasm-tools 
on [Github](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/releases). To build 
from source code, first [install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install),
then use _Cargo_ to build wasm-tools:

```bash 
$ cargo install wasm-tools
```

## wit-bindgen 

The `wit-bindgen` tool, also from the Bytecode Alliance, is a tool for generating
language bindings from WIT interfaces, which makes it easier to both consume 
dependencies, as well as export functionality, from components in a variety 
of programming languages with immature support for the component model.

`wit-bindgen` generates bindings for a number of languages, including:

  - C/C++
  - Rust 
  - Java (TeaVM)
  - Go (TinyGo)
  - C#
