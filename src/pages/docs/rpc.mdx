# Worker to Worker communication

## Concept

Golem allows creating and invoking **workers** through its [REST API](/docs/rest-api/worker) or [command-line interface](/docs/golem-cli), using the rules defined on the [template interface](/docs/template-interface) page. These methods are for working with Golem workers from the outside world. However, the public API for calling one worker from another is not very convenient.

Golem instead introduces a new way to do worker-to-worker communication, using a method called **WASM RPC**. This consists of the following building blocks:

- Golem provides a **host resource** for workers, which can be imported into any Golem project and used to invoke a remote worker by passing the target worker, the name of the invoked function and its parameters in a dynamic way using a data type called `wit-value`.
- A CLI tool called `wasm-rpc-stubgen` can take any Golem worker, and generate a pair of a WIT definition and a WASM component implementing a "stub" for remotely calling that given worker. The generated stub internally uses the above mentioned low-level invocation API, providing a typed interface for working with a remote Golem worker.
- The generated stub can be **composed** with other Golem workers using standard WASM tooling to get a resulting WASM ready to be uploaded as a Golem template, capable of typed worker-to-worker communication.

## Details

### Low-level interface

The low-level host interface this technique uses is defined in [wasm-rpc.wit](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/blob/main/wit/deps/wasm-rpc/wasm-rpc.wit) as the following:

```rust
package golem:rpc@0.1.0;

interface types {
  type node-index = s32;

  record wit-value {
    nodes: list<wit-node>,
  }

  variant wit-node {
    record-value(list<node-index>),
    variant-value(tuple<u32, option<node-index>>),
    enum-value(u32),
    flags-value(list<bool>),
    tuple-value(list<node-index>),
    list-value(list<node-index>),
    option-value(option<node-index>),
    result-value(result<option<node-index>, option<node-index>>),
    prim-u8(u8),
    prim-u16(u16),
    prim-u32(u32),
    prim-u64(u64),
    prim-s8(s8),
    prim-s16(s16),
    prim-s32(s32),
    prim-s64(s64),
    prim-float32(float32),
    prim-float64(float64),
    prim-char(char),
    prim-bool(bool),
    prim-string(string),
  }

  record uri {
    value: string,
  }

  variant rpc-error {
    protocol-error(string),
    denied(string),
    not-found(string),
    remote-internal-error(string)
  }

  resource wasm-rpc {
    constructor(location: uri);

    invoke-and-await: func(function-name: string, function-params: list<wit-value>) -> result<wit-value, rpc-error>;
  }
}

world wit-value {
    import types;
}
```

### Worker URI

The **worker URI** that has to be passed to the remote interface as a parameter identifies a specific **Golem worker**, consisting of the **template ID** and the **worker name**.
It can be constructed by hand using the pattern `worker://template-id/worker-name`, and a running worker can get its own URI using the Golem-specific host function `golem:api/host/get-self-uri`.

### Stub generator

The latest version of `golem-cli` and `golem-cloud-cli` contains a `stubgen` subcommand which implements a set of tools to generate and integrate WASM RPC stubs:

```
WASM RPC stub generator

Usage: golem-cli stubgen [OPTIONS] <COMMAND>

Commands:
  generate              Generate a Rust RPC stub crate for a WASM component
  build                 Build an RPC stub for a WASM component
  add-stub-dependency   Adds a generated stub as a dependency to another WASM component
  compose               Compose a WASM component with a generated stub WASM
  initialize-workspace  Initializes a Golem-specific cargo-make configuration in a Cargo workspace for automatically generating stubs and composing results
  help                  Print this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)

Options:
  -v, --verbose...  Increase logging verbosity
  -q, --quiet...    Decrease logging verbosity
  -h, --help        Print help
```

#### stubgen generate

```shell
Generate a Rust RPC stub crate for a WASM component

Usage: golem-cli stubgen generate [OPTIONS] --source-wit-root <SOURCE_WIT_ROOT> --dest-crate-root <DEST_CRATE_ROOT>

Options:
  -s, --source-wit-root <SOURCE_WIT_ROOT>
          The root directory of the component's WIT definition to be called via RPC
  -d, --dest-crate-root <DEST_CRATE_ROOT>
          The target path to generate a new stub crate to
  -w, --world <WORLD>
          The world name to be used in the generated stub crate. If there is only a single world in the source root package, no need to specify
      --stub-crate-version <STUB_CRATE_VERSION>
          The crate version of the generated stub crate [default: 0.0.1]
      --wasm-rpc-path-override <WASM_RPC_PATH_OVERRIDE>
          The path to the `wasm-rpc` crate to be used in the generated stub crate. If not specified, the latest version of `wasm-rpc` will be used
```

The parameters have the following meaning:

- `--source-wit-root` must point to the directory of the WIT specification of the **worker to be called remotely**. This is usually a `wit` subdirectory in the worker's template's source code.
- `--dest-crate-root` is a new directory where the generated RPC stub will be put. The tool's current version does not generate a WASM file directly, instead it outputs a complete Rust crate which can be compiled via `cargo component build` (as described on the [Rust page](/docs/building-templates/tier-1/rust)) or included in a Rust workspace.
- `--world` can be used to select the exported world from the source WIT, if there are more than one. If there is only one world defined, there is no need to use this parameter.
- `--stub-crate-version` sets the generated Rust crate's version to the given value.
- `--wasm-rpc-path-override` is useful when working on the `wasm-rpc` crate itself, to point the dependency to a local path instead of using the published version.

The generated crate will contain a new WIT file - named `wit/_stub.wit` - which contains all the exported functions, interfaces and resources from the _source worker's WIT specification_, but each of them is packaged into an exported **resource** representing the remote connection to a specific remote worker. The generated Rust code implements these exported resources using the low-level invocation interface defined above.

For example if the original worker's WIT exported an interface and a resource through a function:

```rust
package golem:component;

interface api {
  resource counter {
    constructor(name: string);
    inc-by: func(value: u64);
    get-value: func() -> u64;

    merge-counters: static func(counter1: counter, counter2: counter, name: string) -> counter;
  }

  get-all-counters: func() -> list<counter>;
}

world my-world {
  export api;
}
```

The generated stub WIT specification for the above interface will be:

```rust
package golem:component-stub;

interface stub-my-world {
  use golem:rpc/types@0.1.0.{uri};

  resource api {
    constructor(location: uri);
    get-all-counters: func() -> list<counter>;
  }

  resource counter {
    constructor(location: uri, name: string);
    inc-by: func(value: u64);
    get-value: func() -> u64;
    merge-counters: static func(counter1: counter, counter2: counter, name: string) -> counter;
  }

}

world wasm-rpc-stub-my-world {
  export stub-my-world;
}
```

Each exported interface and resource becomes a new **resource**, accepting a remote worker URI as a parameter.

#### stubgen build

```shell
Build an RPC stub for a WASM component

Usage: golem-cli stubgen build [OPTIONS] --source-wit-root <SOURCE_WIT_ROOT> --dest-wasm <DEST_WASM> --dest-wit-root <DEST_WIT_ROOT>

Options:
  -s, --source-wit-root <SOURCE_WIT_ROOT>
          The root directory of the component's WIT definition to be called via RPC
      --dest-wasm <DEST_WASM>
          The name of the stub WASM file to be generated
      --dest-wit-root <DEST_WIT_ROOT>
          The directory name where the generated WIT files should be placed
  -w, --world <WORLD>
          The world name to be used in the generated stub crate. If there is only a single world in the source root package, no need to specify
      --stub-crate-version <STUB_CRATE_VERSION>
          The crate version of the generated stub crate [default: 0.0.1]
      --wasm-rpc-path-override <WASM_RPC_PATH_OVERRIDE>
          The path to the `wasm-rpc` crate to be used in the generated stub crate. If not specified, the latest version of `wasm-rpc` will be used. It needs to be an **absolute path**
```

Similar to the `stubgen generate` subcommand, but instead of generating the source code for a Rust crate, it builds the stub WASM directly.

The parameters have the following meaning:

- `--source-wit-root` must point to the directory of the WIT specification of the **worker to be called remotely**. This is usually a `wit` subdirectory in the worker's template's source code.
- `--dest-wasm` is the target WASM file to be generated.
- `--dest-wit-root` is the target **directory** where the stub's WIT file and its dependencies will be generated into.
- `--world` can be used to select the exported world from the source WIT, if there are more than one. If there is only one world defined, there is no need to use this parameter.
- `--stub-crate-version` sets the generated Rust crate's version to the given value.
- `--wasm-rpc-path-override` is useful when working on the `wasm-rpc` crate itself, to point the dependency to a local path instead of using the published version. It must be an **absolute path**.

See the `stubgen generate` command's description above for more details about the generated WIT interface.

#### stubgen add-stub-dependency

```shell
Adds a generated stub as a dependency to another WASM component

Usage: golem-cli stubgen add-stub-dependency [OPTIONS] --stub-wit-root <STUB_WIT_ROOT> --dest-wit-root <DEST_WIT_ROOT>

Options:
  -s, --stub-wit-root <STUB_WIT_ROOT>  The WIT root generated by either `generate` or `build` command
  -d, --dest-wit-root <DEST_WIT_ROOT>  The WIT root of the component where the stub should be added as a dependency
  -o, --overwrite                      This command would not do anything if it detects that it would change an existing WIT file's contents at the destination. With this flag, it can be forced to overwrite those files
  -u, --update-cargo-toml              Enables updating the Cargo.toml file in the parent directory of `dest-wit-root` with the copied dependencies
```

This is a follow-up step after generating (and/or building) the RPC stub. It takes the generated stub's WIT specification and integrates it into another project's WIT specification as a dependency, so that other project can use the stub interface for the remote procedure call.

The parameters have the following meaning:

- `--stub-wit-root` must point to the directory of the WIT specification of the **generated stub**. This is the `wit` directory in the output of `stubgen generate` or the directory passed by `--dest-wit-root` to `stubgen build`.
- `--dest-wit-root` is the `wit` directory of the Golem project that will **use** the generated stub for remote worker calls.
- `--overwrite` is an optional flag to force overwriting the destination WIT files if they already exist.
- `--update-cargo-toml` is an optional flag to update the `Cargo.toml` file in the parent directory of `dest-wit-root` with the copied dependencies. While the command in general works with any guest language, this extra flag enables support for Rust projects built by `cargo-component` where the dependencies are listed in the `Cargo.toml` file.

#### stubgen compose

```shell
Compose a WASM component with a generated stub WASM

Usage: golem-cli stubgen compose [OPTIONS] --source-wasm <SOURCE_WASM> --stub-wasm <STUB_WASM> --dest-wasm <DEST_WASM>

Options:
      --source-wasm <SOURCE_WASM>  The WASM file of the caller component
      --stub-wasm <STUB_WASM>      The WASM file of the generated stub. Multiple stubs can be listed
      --dest-wasm <DEST_WASM>      The name of the composed WASM file to be generated
```

The `compose` subcommand is an alternative for using the general purpose `wasm-tools compose` command providing a simpler way to compose the generated RPC stubs with the compiled WASM components using these stubs.

Compiling a project that uses a stub as a dependency cannot be directly uploaded to Golem, as its stub dependencies will not be satisfied by the Golem worker executor. It first has to be **composed** with the compiled stub WASMs.
This is the last step to be performed before uploading the WASM to Golem.

The parameters have the following meaning:

- `--source-wasm` is the WASM file of the caller component (the one depending on the stub).
- `--stub-wasm` is the WASM file of the generated stub. Multiple stubs can be listed.
- `--dest-wasm` is the target WASM file to be generated. This is the file that can be uploaded to Golem.

#### stubgen initialize-workspace

```shell
Initializes a Golem-specific cargo-make configuration in a Cargo workspace for automatically generating stubs and composing results

Usage: golem-cli stubgen initialize-workspace [OPTIONS] --targets <TARGETS> --callers <CALLERS>

Options:
      --targets <TARGETS>
          List of subprojects to be called via RPC
      --callers <CALLERS>
          List of subprojects using the generated stubs for calling remote workers
      --wasm-rpc-path-override <WASM_RPC_PATH_OVERRIDE>
          The path to the `wasm-rpc` crate to be used in the generated stub crate. If not specified, the latest version of `wasm-rpc` will be used
```

If all the workers involved in worker to worker communication have their source code in a single **cargo workspace**, then this command can be used to add a [cargo-make](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) build specification that performs all the above steps automatically when building the workspace with `cargo make build-flow` or `cargo make release-build-flow`.

The parameters have the following meaning:

- `--targets` is a list of subprojects to be called via RPC. These are the projects that the tool will generate stubs for.
- `--callers` is a list of subprojects using (any of) the generated stubs for calling remote workers.
- `--wasm-rpc-path-override` is useful when working on the `wasm-rpc` crate itself, to point the dependency to a local path instead of using the published version. It must be an **absolute path**.

The `initialize-workspace` command is supposed to be used only once in a workspace. After it succeeds, `cargo make build-flow` and `cargo make release-build-flow` can be used to build the workspace, and the generated stubs will be automatically added as dependencies to the caller projects and the compiled WASM files will be composed with the stubs.

## Example

Please read the [worker to worker communication blog post](https://www.golem.cloud/post/worker-to-worker-communication) for a full example of how to use the stub generator calling one worker from another.
