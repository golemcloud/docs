# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and
deploy highly reliabile distributed systems.

When developing for Golem, you normally don't need to worry about most of  
the complexity of ensuring reliable execution. Golem takes care of the heavy
lifting for you, ensuring that your applications are resilient, robust,
fault-tolerant, and highly available.

However, when evaluating Golem for your use case, it is essential to understand
exactly what guarantees Golem provides, what you need to handle on your own,
and how you can tune Golem to meet your specific requirements.

In this section, we'll explore all of these aspects in detail, starting with
the essential concepts of reliability in distributed systems.

# Essential Concepts

In the field of distributed systems, several technical concepts are crucial to
the development of reliable solutions:

1. **Resiliency**: The system's ability to correctly identify and respond to
   failures in external dependencies.
2. **Robustness**: The system's capacity to prevent, identify, and correctly
   respond to internal failures.
3. **Fault-Tolerance**: The system's ability to continue functioning correctly
   even when experiencing one or more faults.
4. **High-Availability**: The system's capability to remain available and
   responsive under various conditions, including partial failures or high stress.

Let's explore each of these concepts in detail to understand how they
contribute to overall system reliability.

## Resiliency

Resiliency is the ability of a system to continue functioning correctly even in
the presence of failures in the systems it interacts with.

Modern systems interact with numerous remote components through network
protocols. These external systems can fail in various ways, presenting
challenges for maintaining overall system reliability.

Common types of external failures include:

- **Network Failures**: Disruptions in connectivity, degraded performance, or
  unstable connections preventing reliable communication.
- **Internal Failures in Remote Systems**: Bugs, crashes, or other malfunctions
  within external systems causing incorrect behavior or non-responsiveness.
- **Load-Related Failures**: Overwhelmed systems leading to degraded performance
  or total unavailability.
- **Maintenance-Related Downtime**: Planned or unplanned system updates,
  migrations, or other maintenance activities causing temporary unavailability.
- **API Versioning Incompatibilities**: Mismatches between different versions of
  interacting systems or APIs leading to errors or unpredictable outcomes.
- **Authorization and Authentication Issues**: Invalid credentials,
  insufficient permissions, or other access-related problems.

Highly resilient systems employ various strategies to handle these external
failures:

1. **Intelligent Retry Mechanisms**: Implementing advanced retry policies,
   often combining exponential backoff with random jitter to handle transient
   failures gracefully.
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Temporarily disabling calls to failing services
   to prevent cascading failures.
3. **Bulkhead Pattern**: Isolating components to ensure that failures in one
   part of the system don't bring down the entire application.

## Robustness

Robustness is the ability of a system to both prevent, as well as identify and
correctly respond to, failures of the system itself.

Internal failure scenarios can be categorized into a hierarchy, ranging from
business logic issues to infrastructure problems:

- **Defect Failures**: Errors due to software defects, such as null pointer
  exceptions, buffer overflows, or division by zero.
- **Domain Failures**: Failures to handle scenarios anticipated and specified
  by the business logic.
- **Unrecoverable Failures**: Situations where the software cannot recover,
  such as database access failures due to incorrect configuration.
- **OS Faults**: Operating system interference with process execution.
- **Hardware Faults**: Failures in critical hardware components like RAM,
  CPU, or network interfaces.

Strategies for improving robustness include:

1. **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implementing thorough error handling
   covering various failure scenarios.
2. **Graceful Degradation**: Allowing systems to continue operating with
   reduced functionality rather than complete shutdown when encountering
   non-critical failures.
3. **Rapid Failure Detection**: Quickly identifying and reporting internal
   failures to enable fast resolution.

## Fault-Tolerance

Fault-tolerant systems are designed to continue functioning correctly even in
the presence of one or more faults. Fault-tolerance can be considered a
specific type of robustness, focusing on a system's ability to handle systemic
issues.

Strategies for fault-tolerant systems include:

1. **Replication**: Duplicating critical components across multiple nodes to
   ensure continued operation if some nodes fail.
2. **State Management**: Implementing robust state management tools to allow
   systems to recover gracefully from failures without data loss.
3. **Failover Mechanisms**: Automatically redirecting traffic to healthy nodes
   in case of node failures.

## High-Availability

High-availability systems are designed to be accessible and responsive to their
intended workloads, even under conditions of partial failure or stress.

Strategies for achieving high availability include:

1. **Load Balancing**: Distributing traffic across multiple instances to
   prevent any single point of failure.
2. **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjusting resources based on demand to
   ensure optimal performance during peak times.
3. **Geographic Distribution**: Deploying across multiple geographic regions
   to reduce latency and improve resilience against regional outages.

# Reliability: Bringing It All Together

Reliability is a comprehensive term that encompasses all of the preceding
concepts. A _highly reliable_ system is one that is:

- Resilient to external failures
- Robust in handling internal failures
- Fault-tolerant to systemic issues
- Highly available under various conditions

By addressing each of these aspects, developers can create distributed systems
that ensure data integrity, maintain consistent performance, and provide a
seamless experience for end-users, even in the face of various challenges and
failure scenarios.

# High-Reliability with Golem

With any programming language, tech stack, or SDK, Golem automatically provides
you with a high degree of built-in reliability.

These guarantees are summarized as follows:

- **Transactional execution**. Golem ensures that your workers execute
  transactionally. Once they begin execution, they will complete execution,
  even if there are software or hardware faults, restarts, or updates.
- **Durable state**. Golem ensures that the state of your workers is durable.
  If a worker is recovered after a failure, it will resume with the same state
  as before the failure.
- **Reliable internal communication**. Golem ensures that communication
  between workers is delivered reliably. If a message is sent, it will
  eventually be delivered, with exactly-once semantics; even if there are
  network partitions, faults, or other failures.
- **Resilient external communication**. Golem automatically applies retry
  strategies and other techniques to ensure that transient failures of
  external systems do not affect reliability.

In the following sections, we will explore these guarantees in more detail,
looking at how each of them improves different faucets of reliability.

## Resiliency

As discussed in [Components](concepts-components.mdx), all components deployed
on Golem ultimately derive their capability to interact with external systems
from _WASI_, which is the Posix-like interface provided by the WASM component
model.

WASI provides facilities to interact with file systems, sockets, time, and other
system resources in a portable and secure manner.

Because Golem provides a custom implementation of WASI, it has direct insight
into the interactions between components and the underlying system. This allows
Golem to detect a variety of transient failure scenarios and automatically
apply resiliency strategies, such as retries, to ensure that the system remains
resilient to these failures.

Golem automatically applies retry strategies to the following types of failures:

- HTTP Request Failures

In the case of errors which are not resolved on their own, Golem will
eventually give up and mark the worker as failed. This is to prevent the
system from getting stuck in an infinite loop of retries.

These workers can be detected using worker enumeration.

### Limitations

Golem does not have awareness into transient errors that are expressed in protocol-
agnostic ways. For example, if an HTTP response contains a 200 status code, but
the body contains a transient error, then Golem will not be able to detect this
error and attempt recovery.

You should be aware of this limitation when designing your applications, and
consider implementing your own retry strategies for such cases.

### Customization

Currently, you can customize a worker's retry policy, including number of
retries, delays, and so on, but it is a global setting that applies to all
failed operations. See [Golem host functions](/docs/golem-host-functions) for
more details, or langauge-specific SDKs.

## Fault-Tolerance

Golem's fault-tolerance guarantees are focused on ensuring that your workers
are executed transactionally and that their state is durable, regardless of
software or hardware faults, restarts, or updates.

In order to more precisely define the scope of these guarantees, we need to
introduce some terminology:

- **Failure Event**. A _failure event_ is any event that causes a worker to
  interrupt execution, but excluding all internal errors in the worker itself.
  This includes operating system faults, hardware faults, disruptions
  (termination through the container orchestrator), restarts, and updates.
- **Supervision**. _Supervision_ is the process by which Golem detects failure
  events and takes action to recover interrupted workers.
- **Recovery**. _Recovery_ is the process by which Golem restores the state of
  a worker to its state before the failure event, and resumes execution.

### Limitations

Golem's fault-tolerant guarantees are extensive, and they enable you to build
highly reliable distributed systems without having to think about most failure
scenarios. However, you should be aware of the following limitation:

- **Execution Semantics**. For external systems (those not executed by Golem),
  Golem generally guarantees only _at-least once semantics_ with respect to
  the last external request made before the failure event.

The following section discusses this limitation in more depth and what you can
do to mitigate it.

### Execution Semantics

All local code, as well as all communication between workers, is executed with
exactly-once semantics. All local code executed strictly inside Golem,
including worker-to-worker communication, is guaranteed to have exactly-once
semantics. This means that during recovery, the state of the worker is restored
to the exact state it was in before the failure event, and no operations
performed by the worker are repeated.

However, for remote operations, such as invoking an HTTP API, Golem cannot
generally guarantee exactly-once semantics. This is because a failure event
may occur after a request has been sent, but before the response has been
received. In this scenario, during the recovery, the request must be retried,
which may lead to the remote system processing the same request multiple times.

To mitigate this issue, you should consider using HTTP APIs that support the
[The Idempotency-Key HTTP Header Field](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpapi-idempotency-key-header/).
This header allows you to provide a unique key for each request, which the
remote system can use to ensure that the request is idempotent.

In a future release, Golem will automatically generate idempotency keys for
each request. For now, however, you can use the language-specific Golem SDK
to generate an idempotency key, which you can then pass to the remote system.

<Callout type="warning">
  It is recommended to use the Golem SDK to generate idempotency keys, rather than generating them
  yourself, to ensure that Golem transactionally _commits_ the key to durable persistence right
  away. If you generate a random idempotency key yourself, without also using the Golem SDK to
  manually perform a commit, then there is a small but nonzero chance that a failure event could
  happen after the HTTP API is invoked, but before the idempotency key is committed to durable
  persistence.
</Callout>

Idempotency keys guarantee exactly-once semantics for requests that support
them, ensuring that the remote system can safely process the request multiple
times without causing any side effects.

## High-Availability

Golem is designed to to be highly-available with respect to the creation and
execution of new workers in the Golem cluster.

This is accomplished by supporting large cluster sizes that can evenly
distribute workloads any number of nodes, and by automatically rebalancing
workloads across the cluster when nodes are added or removed.

However, because Golem allows and encourages communication with specific,
stateful workers, there are limitations around the availability of specific
workers in the cluster.

The following sections overview these limitations.

### Limitations

The availability of specific workers in a Golem cluster is affected by several
different factors, including all of the following:

- **Cluster Size**. The number of worker executor nodes in the cluster.
  If the cluster is too small, then it may not be able to handle the
  workload, leading to degraded performance or unavailability.
- **Cluster Resizing**. Cluster resizing requires rebalancing the workload
  across the new set of nodes. This process may take some time, during which
  availability of specific workers being relocated may be degraded.
- **Worker Executor Node Health**. If the node running a shard of workers goes
  down, then those workers will be unavailable until the node is recovered.
  This process may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes,
  depending on how quickly the failure is detected and the number of workers
  in the shard.
- **Shard Manager Health**. If the shard manager goes down, there are scenarios
  where this can negatively impact availability.

### Tuning

Though not supported currently, it is very likely Golem will increase the
availability of specific high-priority workers by supporting instant-failover.

# Conclusion

Throughout this document, we've explored the crucial aspects of reliability in
distributed systems and how Golem addresses these challenges. We began by
examining the four pillars of reliability: resiliency, robustness, fault-
tolerance, and high availability. These concepts form the foundation for
creating dependable systems that can withstand various failure scenarios and
maintain consistent performance.

Golem provides a robust set of built-in reliability guarantees that
significantly simplify the development of highly reliable distributed systems.
These include transactional execution, durable state management, reliable
internal communication, and resilient external communication.

By automatically handling many complex reliability concerns, Golem allows
developers to focus on their core business logic rather than intricate failure
handling mechanisms. While Golem offers substantial reliability features, it's
essential to understand its current limitations. These include the potential
for at-least-once semantics in certain external system interactions and
limitations in the availability of specific workers during cluster changes.
However, Golem's team is actively working on addressing these areas, with
plans for customizable retry strategies and improved worker availability on
the horizon.

For developers leveraging Golem, a deep understanding of these reliability
concepts and Golem's capabilities is crucial. This knowledge allows you to make
informed decisions about system design, identify areas where additional
reliability measures may be necessary, and fully utilize Golem's built-in
features to create robust distributed applications.

As distributed systems continue to grow in complexity and importance, platforms
like Golem evolve to meet these challenges. Future releases promise to bring
even more advanced reliability features, such as automatic idempotency key
generation and instant failover for high-priority workers, further enhancing
Golem's ability to support mission-critical applications.

In conclusion, Golem provides a powerful foundation for building highly reliable
distributed systems. By abstracting away many of the complexities associated with
fault-tolerance and high availability, it enables developers to create resilient
applications that can withstand the unpredictable nature of distributed
environments.

As you embark on your journey with Golem, remember that reliability is not just a
feature, but a fundamental aspect of system design that Golem helps you achieve
with greater ease and confidence.
