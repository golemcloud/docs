# Reliability

The Golem platform makes it simple to build and deploy highly-
reliable distributed systems.

In this section, you will learn how Golem defines _reliability_,
exactly what guarantees you can expect from deploying your
software on Golem, and how you can tune these guarantees to
meet the specific needs of your applications.

## Essential Concepts

In any distributed system, there are two technical measures that
are essential to the development of reliable distributed systems:

- **Resiliency**. _Resiliency_ is a measure of the system's ability
  to correctly identify and respond to failures of other systems that
  the system interacts with.
- **Robustness**. _Robustness_ is a measure of the system's ability
  to both prevent, as well as identify and correctly respond to,
  failures of the system itself.

In the following two sections, we will explore different faucets of
both resiliency and robustness.

### Resiliency

Every modern cloud system interacts with numerous other systems through
network protocols. Many of these systems maintain state, while others
offer computational processing capabilities (such as a video transcoding
service or a model execution service).

Because other systems are unconstrained, they may fail for any
reason at all. However, broadly speaking, the failure scenarios can
be categorized as follows:

- **Network Failures**. Network failures occur when connectivity
  between systems is disrupted, degraded, or unstable, preventing
  reliable communication.
- **Internal Failures**. Internal failures arise from bugs, crashes,
  or other malfunctions within the system itself, causing incorrect
  behavior or complete non-responsiveness.
- **Load Failures**. Load failures happen when a system is overwhelmed
  by requests or processing demands, leading to degraded performance
  or total unavailability.
- **Maintenance Failures**. Maintenance failures result from planned
  or unplanned system updates, migrations, or other maintenance
  activities that cause downtime or unexpected behavior.
- **Versioning Failures**. Versioning failures stem from
  incompatibilities between different versions of interacting systems
  or APIs, leading to errors or unpredictable outcomes.
- **Authorization Failures**. Authorization failures occur due to
  invalid or expired credentials, insufficient permissions, or other
  issues preventing legitimate access to required resources.

Not all types of failures are survivable. For example, an authorization
failure is likely to result from invalid or expired credentials, and
cannot be resolved from within the system itself.

That said, most failures in external systems are transient: network
failures resolve themselves; internal failures either have
transient causes or are due to fixable bugs; load failures are resolved
by waiting until a period of reduced load or by auto-scaling.

Highly resilient systems continue to function even in the presence of
transient failures. They do so by applying specialized retry policies,
which often combine exponential falloff with random jitter. Other
patterns, such as circuit breaker and bulkhead, are also deployed to
improve the resiliency of distributed systems.

### Robustness

Whereas resilient systems can adeptly deal with transient failures in
the external systems they interact with, robust systems both prevent
and correctly respond to internal failures.

The concept of robustness applies both to _running processes_, such as
a web server or request handler, and to the _infrastructure_ where the
processes are running, which includes the operating system and even
the machine on which the system executes.

Internal failure scenarios can be placed into a hierarchy, indicating
whether they are closer to business logic or closer to infrastructure,
and broadly characterized as follows:

- **Defect Failures**. Defect failures occur because of defects in
  the software, such as a failure to handle a null pointer, a
  buffer overflow, or a division by zero.
- **Domain Failures**. Domain failures occur when software does not
  handle failure scenarios that are anticipated and specified by the
  business, such as failure to prompt the user to correct an invalid
  postal code during payment processing.
- **Unrecoverable Failures**. Unrecoverable failures occur when
  the software does not have the ability to recover from some failure,
  such as when database access fails due to incorrect configuration.
- **OS Faults**. Operating system faults occur when the operating
  system itself interferes with the ability of a process to run to
  completion, such as the infamous blue screen of death in Windows.
- **Hardware Faults**. Hardware faults occur when critical hardware
  components fail, such as the failure of RAM, CPU, or network.

### Reliability

_Reliability_ is a measure of a system's resiliency _and_ robustness.
Reliable software is adept at preventing, identifying, and responding to
both external and internal failures.
