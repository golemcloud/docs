# Reliability

The Golem platform makes it simple to build and deploy highly-
reliable distributed systems.

In this section, you will learn how Golem defines _reliability_,
exactly what guarantees you can expect from deploying your 
software on Golem, and how you can tune these guarantees to 
meet the specific needs of your applications.

## Essential Concepts

In any distributed system, there are two technical measures that 
are essential to the development of reliable distributed systems:

 * **Resiliency**. _Resiliency_ is a measure of the system's ability 
 to correctly identify and correctly respond to failures of other 
 systems that the system interacts with.
 * **Robustness**. _Robustness_ is a measure of the system's ability 
to both prevent, as well as identify and correctly respond to, failures 
of the system itself.

In the following two sections, we will explore different faucets of 
both resiliency and robustness.

### Resiliency

Every modern cloud system interacts with numerous other systems through
network protocols. Many of these systems maintain state, while others 
offer computational processing capabilities (such as a video transcoding 
service or a model execution service).

Because other systems are unconstrained, they may fail for any 
reason at all. However, broadly speaking, the failure scenarios can 
be categorized as follows:

 * **Network Failures**. 
 * **Internal Failures**. 
 * **Load Failures**. 
 * **Maintenance Failures**. 
 * **Versioning Failures**. 
 * **Authorization Failures**. 

Not all types of failures are survivable. For example, an authorization 
failure is likely to result from invalid or expired credentials, and 
cannot be resolved from within the system itself.

That said, most failures in external systems are transient: most network 
failures resolve themselves; internal failures either have 
transient causes or are due to bugs that can be fixed; load failures 
are resolved by time or auto-scaling; and so on.

Highly resilient systems continue to function even in the presence of 
transient failures. They do so by applying specialized retry policies, 
which often combine exponential falloff with random jitter. Other 
patterns, such as circuit breaker and bulkhead, can also be used to 
improve the resiliency of a distributed system.

### Robustness



### Reliability

_Reliability_ is a measure of a system's resiliency *and* robustness. 
This means that reliable software is adept at preventing, identifying,
and responding to both external and internal failures.
