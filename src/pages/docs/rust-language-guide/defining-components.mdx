# Defining Golem Components in Rust

## Creating a project

The simplest way to create a new Golem project is to use `cargo component new` to create a **library** project:

```shell
$ cargo component new helloworld --lib
```

This will create a new Rust project in a `helloworld` directory that implements a Golem component exporting a single, parameterless function which returns the string `"Hello, World!"`.

Using Golem's **command line interface** instead provides a set of predefined, Golem-specific **examples** to choose from as a starting point.

To see the available exampels for Rust, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli list-examples --language rust
```

<Callout type="info">
  The set of examples provided by Golem CLI is defined in the open-source repository
  [golem-examples](http://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples).
</Callout>

## Specification-first approach

Golem and the Rust toolchain currently requires defining the component's interface using the **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** format. See [the official documentation of this format](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) for reference.

Each new project generated with `golem-cli` (or `cargo component new --lib`) contains a `wit` directory with at least one `.wit` file defining a `world`. This world can contain **exports** (exported functions and interfaces) and these exports will be the compiled Golem component's public API.

The first time a component is compiled (see the [Building Components page](docs/rust-language-guide/building-components) for details), a `bindings.rs` file gets generated in the `src` directory. This module contains the Rust definitions of all the data types and interfaces defined in the `WIT` file(s).

To **implement** the specification written in WIT, the Rust code must implement some of these generated traits and export them using a macro defined in the generated bindings module.

### Exporting top-level functions

WIT allows exporting one or more top-level functions in the `world` section, for example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

world example {
    export hello-world: func() -> string;
}
```

To implement this function in Rust, the following steps must be taken:

- make dure the generated `bindings` module is imported
- define an empty struct representing our component
- implement the generated `Guest` trait for this struct
- call the `export!` macro

Let's see in code:

```rust
// make dure the generated `bindings` module is imported
#[allow(warnings)]
mod bindings;

// define an empty struct representing our component
struct Component;

// implement the generated `Guest` trait for this struct
impl bindings::Guest for Component {
    fn hello_world() -> String {
        "Hello, World!".to_string()
    }
}

// call the `export!` macro
bindings::export!(Component with_types_in bindings);
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that in WIT, identifiers are using the `kebab-case` naming convention, while Rust uses the
  `snake_case` convention. The generated bindings map between the two automatically.
</Callout>

### Exporting interfaces

WIT supports defining and exporting whole _interfaces_, coupling together multiple functions and possibly custom data types.

Take the following example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  add: func(value: u64);
  get: func() -> u64;
}

world example {
  export api;
}
```

This is equivalent to having the two exported functions directly exported from the `world` section, so the implementation is Rust is once again requires to implement the `Guest` trait from the generated `bindings` module:

```rust
#[allow(warnings)]
mod bindings;

struct Component;

impl bindings::exports::golem::demo::api::Guest for Component {
    fn add(value: u64) {
        todo!();
    }

    fn get() -> u64 {
        todo!();
    }
}

bindings::export!(Component with_types_in bindings);
```

<Callout type="info">
  See the **Managing state** section below to learn the recommended way of managing state in Golem
  components, which is required to implement these two functions.
</Callout>

### Exporting resources

The `WIT` format supports defining and exporting **resources** - entities defined by their constructor function and the available methods on them.

Golem supports exporting these resources as part of the worker's API.

The following example modifies the previously seen _counter_ example to define it as a resource, getting the counter's name as a constructor parameter:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {

  resource counter {
    constructor(name: string);
    add: func(value: u64);
    get: func() -> u64;
  }
}

world example {
  export api;
}
```

Resources can have multiple instances within a worker. Their constructor returns a _handle_ which is then used to call the methods on the resource. Learn more about how resources can be implicitly created and invoked through Golem's APIs in the [Invocations page](docs/concepts-invocations).

To implement the above defined WIT resource in Rust a few new steps must be taken:

- define a struct representing the resource - it can contain data!
- implement the trait generated as the resource's interface for this struct
- specify this type in the `Guest` trait's implementation

Let's see in code:

```rust
#[allow(warnings)]
mod bindings;

use std::cell::RefCell;

// define a struct representing the resource
struct Counter {
    name: String,
    value: RefCell<u64>,
}

// implement the trait generated as the resource's interface for this struct
impl bindings::exports::golem::demo::api::GuestCounter for Counter {
    fn new(name: String) -> Self {
        Self {
            name,
            value: RefCell::new(0),
        }
    }

    fn add(&self, value: u64) {
        *self.value.borrow_mut() += value;
    }

    fn get(&self) -> u64 {
        *self.value.borrow()
    }
}

struct Component;

impl bindings::exports::golem::demo::api::Guest for Component {
    type Counter = crate::Counter;
}

bindings::export!(Component with_types_in bindings);
```

Note that the generated trait for the resource is passing non-mutable self references (`&self`) to the methods, so the resource's internal state must be wrapped in a `RefCell` to allow mutation.

### Data types defined in WIT

The `WIT` specifications contains some primitive and higher level data types and also allows defining custom data types which can be used as function parameters and return values on the exported functions, interfaces and resources.

The following table shows an example of each `WIT` data type and its corresponding Rust type:

| WIT type                                       | Rust type                                                                                               |

| `str`                                          | `String`                                                                                                |

| `result<s32, str>`                             | `Result<i32, String>`                                                                                   |
| `result<_, str>`                               | `Result<(), String>`                                                                                    |

## Worker configuration

It is often required to pass _configuration values_ to workers when they are started.

In general Golem supports three different ways of doing this:

1. Defining a list of string arguments passed to the worker, available as **command line arguments**
2. Defining a list of key-value pairs passed to the worker, available as **environment variables**.
3. Using **resource constructors** to pass configuration values to the worker.

### Command line arguments

The command line arguments associated with the Goelm worker can be accessed in Rust using the standard `env::args()` function:

```rust
for arg in std::env::args() {
    println!("{}", arg);
}
```

Command line arguments can only be specified when a worker is **explicitly created** and they are are empty by default, including in cases when the worker was implicitly created by an [invocation](docs/concepts-invocation).

### Environment variables

Environment variables can be accessed in Rust using the standard `env::var()` function:

```rust
let value = std::env::var("KEY").expect("KEY was not specified");
```

Environment variables can be specified when a worker is **explicitly created**, but there are some environment variables that are always set by Golem:

- `GOLEM_WORKER_NAME` - the name of the worker
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_ID` - the ID of the worker's component
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_VERSION` - the version of the component used for this worker

In addition to these, when using [Worker to Worker communication](docs/pages/rust-language-guide/worker-to-worker-communication), workers created by remote calls **inherit the environment variables of the caller**.

This feature makes environment variables a good fit for passing configuration such as hostnames, ports, or access tokens to trees of workers.

### Resource constructors

As explained earlier, Golem workers can export **resources** and these resources can have **constructor parameters**.

Although resources can be used in many ways, one pattern for Golem is only create a single instance of the exported resource in each worker, and use it to pass configuration values to the worker. This is supported by Golem's worker invocation syntax directly, allowing to implicitly create workers and the corresponding resource by a single invocation as described on the [Invocations page](docs/concepts-invocations).

## Managing state

Golem workers are **stateful**. There are two major techniques to store and manipulate state in a Golem worker implemented in Rust:

1. Using a global `thread_local!` variable with `RefCell`
2. Using **resources** and `RefCell`

Note that wrapping the state in `RefCell` is necessary in both cases to allow mutation.

### Using a global `thread_local!` variable with `RefCell`

When exporting top-level functions or functions defined in WIT interfaces, the worker state is _global_. In Rust it is not possible to have mutable global state in safe code so the recommended workaround is to use the `thread_local!` macro.

<Callout type="info">
  Note that Golem workers are always single threaded - the `thread_local!` macro is used here is
  just a convenient way to define global state without requiring use of any additional crates or
  unsafe code.
</Callout>

The following example implements the previously defined _counter_ worker using a `thread_local!` variable:

```rust
#[allow(warnings)]
mod bindings;

struct State {
    total: u64,
}

thread_local! {
    static STATE: RefCell<State> = RefCell::new(State {
        total: 0,
    });
}

struct Component;

impl bindings::exports::golem::demo::api::Guest for Component {
    fn add(value: u64) {
        STATE.with_borrow_mut(|state| state.total += value);
    }

    fn get() -> u64 {
        STATE.with_borrow(|state| state.total)
    }
}

bindings::export!(Component with_types_in bindings);
```

### Using resources and `RefCell`

When exporting a WIT resource, it is possible to have a per-instance `RefCell` holding the resource's state, as it was shown above in the **Exporting resources** section.
