# Working with Golem Promises in Rust

Golem **promises** provide a way for Golem workers to wait on an external condition. The worker creates the promise and somehow sends its identifier to the external system responsible for **completing** the promise. Then the worker can **await** the promise, being suspended until the external system completes the promise using Golem's REST API.

It is also possible to complete a promise from within a Golem worker using the Golem SDK.

When a promise is completed, an arbitrary byte array can be attached to it as a payload - this data is returned to the awaiting worker when is continues execution.

In Rust the easiest way to work with promises is to use the `golem-rust` library.

### Adding as a dependency

To use the Golem Rust library, add the following dependency to your component's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
golem-rust = { version = "0.4.0" }
golem-rust-macro = { version = "0.4.0" }
```

### Creating a promise

To create a promise simply call the `create_promise` function:

```rust
use golem_rust::bindings::golem::api::host::create_promise;

let promise_id = create_promise();
```

The returned value is a `PromiseId`, defined as the following:

```rust
/// A promise ID is a value that can be passed to an external Golem API to complete that promise
/// from an arbitrary external source, while Golem workers can await for this completion.
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct PromiseId {
    pub worker_id: WorkerId,
    pub oplog_idx: OplogIndex,
}

/// An index into the persistent log storing all performed operations of a worker
pub type OplogIndex = u64;

/// Represents a Golem worker
#[derive(Clone)]
pub struct WorkerId {
    pub component_id: ComponentId,
    pub worker_name: String,
}

/// Represents a Golem component
#[derive(Clone, Copy)]
pub struct ComponentId {
    pub uuid: Uuid,
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  Note that although this `Uuid` is a generated type from the `WIT` specification, the `golem-rust`
  crate provides `From` and `Into` implementations to convert it to the `uuid` crate's `Uuid` type.

There are also `From` and `Into` implementations to convert `ComponentId` to `Uuid`, and `Display` and `FromStr` implementations for all the ID types.

</Callout>

### Deleting a promise

If a promise is no longer used, it can be deleted with

```rust
use golem_rust::bindings::golem::api::host::delete_promise;
delete_promise(&promise_id);
```

### Awaiting a promise

To await a promise, use the `await_promise` function:

```rust
use golem_rust::bindings::golem::api::host::await_promise;
let payload = await_promise(&promise_id);
```

The resulting `payload` is a `Vec<u8>` containig the data attached to the promise on completion.

There is a helper function that immediately deserializes the payload with `serde_json`:

```rust
use golem_rust::await_promise_json;
let payload: ExamplePayload = await_promise_json(&promise_id)?;
```

### Completing a promise from within a worker

To complete a promise from within a worker, use the `complete_promise` function:

```rust
use golem_rust::bindings::golem::api::host::complete_promise;
complete_promise(&promise_id, &payload);
```

where `&payload` has the type `&[u8]`.

There is a helper function that serializes the payload with `serde_json`:

```rust
use golem_rust::complete_promise_json;
complete_promise_json(&promise_id, &ExamplePayload { field: "value" })?;
```

### Completing a promise from an external source

To see how to use the **promise ID** to complete a promise through the external REST API, check [the REST API documentation](/docs/rest-api).
