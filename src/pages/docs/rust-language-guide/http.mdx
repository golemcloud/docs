# HTTP requests in Rust

Golem implements the [WASI HTTP](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http) interfaces so any library built on this specification can be used from Golem components to communicate with external services.

Currently there is only one such Rust library available, a fork of the popular `reqwest` library provided by the Golem team: https://github.com/golemcloud/reqwest/tree/update-jun-2024

### Adding as a dependency

To use it, add the following dependency to your component's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { git = "https://github.com/golemcloud/reqwest", branch = "update-jun-2024", features = ["json"] }
```

Optionally add `serde` and `serde_json` to take advantage of `reqwest`'s JSON support:

```toml
serde = { version = "1.0.203", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.117"
```

### Making a request

The fork provides the same API as the official `reqwest` library's blocking API, documented [here](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/blocking/index.html).

In the following example we make a POST request sending a JSON payload and parsing the response as JSON using derived codecs by `serde`.

First let's define the request and response body types:

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct ExampleRequest {
    name: String,
    amount: u32,
    comments: Vec<String>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct ExampleResponse {
    percentage: f64,
    message: Option<String>,
}
```

Then in the worker's implementation we can use `reqwest` in the following way (proper error handling omitted for brevity):

```rust
use reqwest::*;

// ...

let client = Client::builder().build().expect("Failed to create client");

let request_body = ExampleRequest {
    name: "Something".to_string(),
    amount: 42,
    comments: vec!["Hello".to_string(), "World".to_string()],
};

let response: Response = client
    .post(&format!("http://example.com:8080/post-example"))
    .json(&request_body)
    .header("X-Test", "Golem")
    .basic_auth("some", Some("body"))
    .send()
    .expect("Request failed");

let status = response.status();
let body = response
    .json::<ExampleResponse>()
    .expect("Invalid response");

println!("Received {:?} {:?}", status, body);
```
