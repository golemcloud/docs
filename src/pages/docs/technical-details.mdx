# Technical details

This page summarizes some of the technical details for people familiar with the WASM ecosystem.

## Runtime

Golem uses a forked version of [Wasmtime v17.0](https://wasmtime.dev/). The fork contains minimal changes to the original required for implementing the _durability properties_ of Golem. The [forked repository is available on GitHub](https://github.com/golemcloud/wasmtime/tree/golem-wasmtime-17).

## WASI

Golem provides the following host interfaces:

- The [final WASI Preview2](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/preview2/README.md)
- [WASI Logging](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging/)
- [WASI Blobstore](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-blobstore)
- A subset of [WASI KeyValue](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-keyvalue)

<Callout type="info">
  The WASI TCP and UDP interfaces are currently not supporting persistent execution but they are
  added to the linker to avoid linker errors for example with `componentize-py` outputs.
</Callout>

## Component model, tiers, commands, reactors

Golem is built on the [WebAssembly Component Model](https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model) from scratch. The _templates_ for Golem _workers_ are WASM components, and the exported component model _functions_ and _instances_ are directly exposed via Golem's worker API for invocation.

As explained on the [building templates](/docs/building-templates.md) page, Golem uses the concept of **tiers** to categorize support for various guest languages.

The tiers are:

- **Tier 1** would be a platform that built-in support for the component model
- **Tier 2** languages are having a WIT binding generator and thus can be used to implement "reactor" (or "library") components, with multiple exported functions, and they can import and use any of the supported host interfaces.
- **Tier 3** languages have no binding generators, but they can be used with the preview1 adapter to implement "command" components, exposing a single parameterless `run` function. There are Golem features allowing some level of interactivity with these components via standard input and output.
- **Tier 4** languages are everything else

## Repositories

We have the following open-source repositories:

- [Golem](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem) is the primary repository containing all the open-sourced Golem services.
- [Golem WIT](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit) holds all the WIT definitions of the provided WASI interfaces, as well as the matching _preview1 adapter modules_.
- [Golem CLI](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-cli) is the repository for the `golem` command line interface
- [Golem Examples](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples) is a repository of example template projects, exposed by the `golem new ...` command.
- [Golem WASM AST](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wasm-ast) is a higher level library on top of `wasmparser` and `wasm-encoder` used by Golem to analyse the uploaded components.
- [Golem Cloud CLI](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-cloud-cli) is the repository for the Golem Cloud (hosted) command line interface
- [docs](https://github.com/golemcloud/docs) holds these documentation pages.
- [Wasmtime](https://github.com/golemcloud/wasmtime) is the forked version of Wasmtime used by Golem.
- [reqwest](https://github.com/golemcloud/reqwest) is a fork of the Rust `reqwest` library, providing a **WASI-Http based HTTP client**.
- [go-wasi-http](https://github.com/golemcloud/go-wasi-http) is a Go package implementing the [http.RoundTripper](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#RoundTripper) interface, allowing Go programs to use the built-in http client through WASI Http.
- [golem-rust](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-rust) is an experimental set of Rust macros reducing the boilerplate of WIT bindings.
- [golem-openapi-client-generator](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-openapi-client-generator) is a code generator that transforms GOlem's OpenAPI specs into a Rust client library.
- [golem-scalajs-wit-bindgen](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-scalajs-wit-bindgen) is a binding generator from WIT for Scala.js
