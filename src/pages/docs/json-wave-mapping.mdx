# JSON - WAVE mapping

The **invocation API** uses a special JSON format to describe invocation parameters and results. As the parameter and result types are defined by the Web Assembly components, the natural way to encode parameter and return **values** is the [WAVE (WebAssembly Value Encoding)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) format.

When using the REST API, the JSON-encoded values must be extended with a JSON-encoded **type information** as well. This is described in details in the [Invoke via HTTP](/docs/invoke/http) page.

When using the CLI tool, it is possible to either use the WAVE format directly, or use this JSON format as described in details in the [Invoke via CLI](/docs/invoke/cli) page.

The following sections define how each WASM type and it's correspodning WAVE value encoding is mapped to Golem's value JSON format.

## Primitive types

| WIT type | JSON type    | Description                  |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- |
| bool     | JSON boolean | Primitive boolean type       |
| u8       | JSON number  | Unsigned 8-bit integer       |
| s8       | JSON number  | Signed 8-bit integer         |
| u16      | JSON number  | Unsigned 16-bit integer      |
| s16      | JSON number  | Signed 16-bit integer        |
| u32      | JSON number  | Unsigned 32-bit integer      |
| s32      | JSON number  | Signed 32-bit integer        |
| u64      | JSON number  | Unsigned 64-bit integer      |
| s64      | JSON number  | Signed 64-bit integer        |
| f32      | JSON number  | 32-bit floating point number |
| f64      | JSON number  | 64-bit floating point number |
| char     | JSON number  | UTF-8 character              |
| string   | JSON string  | String                       |

## Tuples

The following WIT type:

```wit
tuple<u32, string, char>
```

is encoded in WAVE as

```wit
(1234, "hello world", 'g')
```

and in JSON as an array of the items:

```json
[1234, "hello world", 103]
```

## Lists

The following WIT type:

```wit
list<string>
```

is encoded in WAVE as

```wit
["one", "two", "three"]
```

and in JSON as an array of the items:

```json
["one", "two", "three"]
```

## Options

The following WIT type:

```wit
option<string>
```

is encoded in WAVE by one of the following:

```wit
"implicit some", some("explicit some"), none
```

In the JSON representation we use `null` to reprsent `none` and the inner value if defined:

```json
"implicit some"
null
```

## Results

For the following WIT type:

```wit
result<string, string>
```

The WAVE representation is

```wit
"implicit ok", ok("explicit ok"), err("explicit err")
```

The result type is represented in JSON by an **object** with either an `ok` or an `err` field:

```json
{ "ok": "explicit ok" }
{ "err": "explicit err" }
```

If the type is _unit_ in the WIT definition, the JSON representation should use `null`:

```wit
result<_, string>
```

```json
{ "ok": null }
```

## Handles

Handles are identifying **resources** and returned by invoking **resource constructors** through the Golem invocation API. Handles are represented as strings in the JSON format
and they are not supported by WAVE.

Handles must not be constructed by hand, just forwarded to method invocations as they were returned from the constructors.

Example handle value in JSON representation:

```json
"urn:worker:component-id/worker-name/resource-id"
```

## Records

Records are a collection of named fields. The JSON representation uses the same names as they appear in the WIT definition:

```wit
record {
    a: string,
    b: u32
}
```

An example WAVE encoding for such a record is:

```wit
{ a: "hello", b: 1234 }
```

The JSON representation is just an object with the same field names:

```json
{ "a": "hello", "b": 1234 }
```

## Variants

Variants are encoded in JSON by an **object** with a single field, where the field's name matches one of the variant's cases:

```wit
variant allowed-destinations {
    none,
    any,
    restricted(list<string>),
}
```

The WAVE encoding for such a variant is

```wit
none, any, restricted(["one", "two", "three"])
```

In JSON the object's single field encodes the case, and the value is `null` if it has no inner value in the type:

```json
{ "none": null }
{ "any": null }
{ "restricted": ["one", "two", "three"] }
```

## Enums

Enums are simply encoded by the case name as a JSON string.

For example:

```wit
enum {
    low,
    medium,
    high
}
```

The WAVE encoding for such an enum is:

```wit
low, medium high
```

and in JSON:

```json
"low"
"medium"
"high"
```

## Flags

Flags represent a set of selected values.

Take the following example WIT type:

```wit
flags allowed-methods {
    get,
    post,
    put,
    delete,
}
```

The WAVE encoding lists zero or more elements of the flags within `{}`:

```wit
{get, put}
```

The JSON representation is an array of the selected values, each represented by a string:

```json
["get", "put"]
```
