# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

The fundamental building block of every Golem application is the
[component](#concepts-components), which is instantiated to form
[workers](#concepts-workers). The only way to create or interact with workers is
through _invocations_.

An _invocation_ is the act of invoking an exported function on a specific
worker, by supplying the function with its required input parameters. If the
invoked function has a return value, the invocation will return the value.

Perhaps surprisingly for those new to Golem, every invocation occurs on a
_specific worker_, rather than more generally on a component. If an attempt is
made to invoke a function on a worker that does not exist yet, it will be
created through the act of invocation.

Invocation is such a fundamental aspect of building useful applications on
Golem that in this section, we will discuss the origin of invocations, and
provide high-level instructions on how to perform invocations during
development, testing, and production scenarios.

# Structure of Invocations

The structure of invocations on workers derives from the WASM component model,
which defines the constructs that make up the public APIs of components.

The public API of a component is defined using WASM Interface Types (WIT), a
text format analogous to protocol buffers (protobuf).

Through WIT, components may export functions, which can be called from other
components (as per the component model), but which Golem also makes available
for remote invocation through multiple protocols.

Understanding the structure of invocations, then, comes down to understanding
the structure of component model types, as defined by WIT.

In the next section, you will learn the basics of this structure. For a more
detailed reference, you can see the page on [Function names](/docs/function-names).

## Basic Invocations

Assume we have created a component designed to provide durable counters, whose
public API is defined by the following WIT:

```wit
package demo:counter;

interface counters {
  get-total-counters: func() -> u32;

  increment-counter: func(index: s32) -> s32;

  get-counter: func(index: s32) -> s32;
}
```

This API defines three standalone functions, named `get-total-counters`,
`increment-counter`, and `get-counter`.

In order to perform an invocation on a worker created from this component, we
will need two specify two things:

1. The fully qualified name of the function that we are invoking on the worker.
2. The parameters to invoke the function with, which must have the correct
   structure.

The structure of the name of the function is fully standardized across all
supported invocation protocols, and is as follows:

```
<package-name>/<interface-name>.{<function-name>}
```

So, in the preceding example, if we wish to invoke the `get-total-counters`
function on some worker, we must utilize the following fully qualified name:

```
demo:counter/counters.{get-total-counters}
```

This name identifies the `get-total-counters` function, unique from any other
function that is exported by the component.

You will learn how to specify parameters later, when the different supported
protocols are introduced. For more information on the structure of function
names, see the page on [Function names](/docs/function-names).

## Resource Invocations

In the WASM component model, resources are similar to classes in object-oriented
programming languages. Like classes, they have constructors and methods.

Because Golem is a durable computing platform, it is natural to use workers to
store persistent information. For example, a user profile worker might store
information related to a user; while an auction worker might store all
information related to an online auction, including bids and bidders.

Accomplishing this in some programming languages is straightforward. For
example, a counter component written in C/C++ could have a global variable to
keep track of a count, and then it could export two functions: one to retrieve
the current total, and one to adjust the counter, up or down.

However, some languages, including strongly object-oriented languages like Java,
as well as languages like Haskell and Rust, strongly discourage or prevent
global state.

Because resources must be constructed before their methods can be invoked, the
state associated with a resource need not be global, which provides a much more
natural fit for many programming languages.

Golem has special support for invoking methods on resources that is designed to
greatly simplify these use cases. In particular, Golem supports an easy way
to invoke methods on resources that are uniquely identified by their
constructor parameters, and automatically constructs resources as necessary.

<Callout type="warning">
  <div>
    In order to use Golem's special support for invoking methods on resources, each resource in your
    component must be uniquely identified by constructor parameters _alone_. If the constructor
    parameters of your resource are not sufficient to uniquely identify a desired instance of that
    resource, then you will have to manage the resource on your own, without Golem's special support
    for invoking methods on the resources.
  </div>
</Callout>

Let's take the following example counter component, which defines a resource
named `counter`:

```wit
package demo:counter;

interface counters {
  get-total-counters: func() -> u32;

  resource counter {
    constructor(id: string);

    increment: func(s32) -> s32;

    get: func() -> s32;
  }
}
```

In an object-oriented programming language such as Java, the `counter` resource
would be bound to a class, with a single constructor and two methods.

Golem allows us to invoke methods on counters that are uniquely identified by
their constructor parameters. In this example, the constructor of a new
`counter` takes an `id` as input, which is intended to be a user-defined string
that uniquely identifies the counter.

In order to invoke methods on a specific counter, we must include the
values for the constructor parameter in the fully qualified name of the function
being invoked.

The generic structure of the fully qualified name for such a resource invocation
is as follows:

```
<package-name>/<interface-name>.{<resource-name>(<resource-params>).<function-name>}
```

In the case of the preceding counter, we could specify the fully qualified name
of the `increment` method on a counter with id `"total-profile-views"` with the
following syntax:

```
demo:counter/counters.{counter("total-profile-views").increment}
```

In English, this fully qualified name indicates we are invoking the method
`increment` on a specific counter, namely, the counter that is constructed with
the constructor parameter `"total-profile-views"`.

If we invoke this method on such a counter, but it does not exist yet, then
Golem will automatically create the counter, and associate it with its
constructor parameters. The next time a method is invoked on this counter, then
Golem will lookup and find the existing counter, and invoke the method on it.

Using Golem's special support for invoking methods on resources enables you to
cleanly and automatically create local state on workers, which provides a
pleasant experience for languages that discourage global state.

We have overlooked one detail of resource invocation: the syntax used for
specifying constructor parameters. The syntax that Golem requires is
[WAVE](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave#readme),
which stands for WebAssembly Value Encoding.

Golem supports WAVE syntax because it has a 1-to-1 mapping with the data types
supported by the WASM component model, ensuring that all resource constructor
parameters have a single unambiguous value representation.

# Performing Invocations

There are four different ways you can perform invocations on workers, each
suited to different use cases:

- **CLI**. The Golem command-line interface (CLI) allows you to invoke any
  function on any worker, providing a user-friendly way to input required
  parameters and display return values. The CLI is useful for development, or
  for interacting with your systems through scripts. For more information, see
  [Invoke Using Golem CLI](#invoke-cli.mdx).
- **Generic REST API**. The Golem REST API allows you to invoke any function on
  any worker. The REST API is a low-level interface designed mostly for
  building tooling, such as the CLI. For more information, see [Invoking Through
  the REST API](#invoke-http.mdx).
- **Custom API**. In order to facilitate interacting with Golem applications,
  Golem makes it easy to build a custom API atop workers. This custom API can
  be high-level and support arbitrary business requirements. For more
  information, see [API Definitions](#concepts-api-definitions.mdx).
- **Workers**. Workers themselves are able to invoke functions on other
  workers, a feature referred to as _worker-to-worker communication_. For more
  information, see
  [Worker-to-Worker Communication](#concepts-worker-to-worker-communication.mdx).
