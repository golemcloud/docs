# Deploy using Docker

To get started we recommend using the Docker Compose file from the [Golem Docker examples](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/tree/main/docker-examples). You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

Once you have Docker Compose installed, you can make use of docker-compose file in Golem repository to spin up Golem.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Download an example docker-compose file along with .env file that has a few common configurations
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemcloud/golem/main/docker-examples/docker-compose-postgres.yaml -O  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemcloud/golem/main/docker-examples/.env

# Start Golem with backend storage as PostgreSQL and Redis
docker-compose -f docker-compose-postgres.yaml up
```

You may need to modify it to suit your needs.
If you are running into any port conflicts you can modify the [.env](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/main/docker-examples/.env) file that was downloaded as part of the above curl command.
[Golem APIs](/docs/rest-api/oss-rest-api.mdx) are exposed on port 9881 by default. Worker [API Gateway](/docs/concepts/worker-gateway.mdx) endpoint is exposed under port 9006.
