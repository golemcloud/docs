## Setup development environment for Python

Python programs can be compiled into WASM components using the tool `componentize-py`. For **Golem** you should use our forked version of this tool, as it pins all its dependencies to the one required by Golem Cloud.

First install Python 3 to your system and once you have access to the `pip` package manager, install `componentize-py` using:

```shell
$ pip install componentize-py==0.13.5

$ componentize-py --version
componentize-py 0.13.5
```

## Install WebAssembly tooling for Worker to Worker communication

Using [Worker to Worker communication](/docs/python-language-guide/rpc) requires **Rust** and **WASM** tooling, because _golem RPC client stubs_ are generated and implemented as _Rust_ components.

<Steps>

### Install Rust

Install rustup

```bash copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Install the latest stable version of Rust

```bash copy
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
```

Add the WASI target

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

</Steps>
