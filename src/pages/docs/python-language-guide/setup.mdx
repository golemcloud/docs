# Setup development environment for Python

Python programs can be compiled into WASM components using the tool `componentize-py`. For **Golem** you should use our forked version of this tool, as it pins all its dependencies to the one required by Golem Cloud.

Download a prebuilt `0.11.0` binary from the following address:

[https://github.com/golemcloud/componentize-py/releases/tag/golem-feb-2024](https://github.com/golemcloud/componentize-py/releases/tag/golem-feb-2024)

To verify it works, try

```shell
$ componentize-py --version
componentize-py 0.11.0
```
