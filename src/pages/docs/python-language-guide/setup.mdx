## Setup development environment for Python

Python programs can be compiled into WASM components using the tool `componentize-py`. For **Golem** you should use our forked version of this tool, as it pins all its dependencies to the one required by Golem Cloud.

First install Python 3 to your system and once you have access to the `pip` package manager, install `componentize-py` using:

```shell
$ pip install componentize-py==0.13.5

$ componentize-py --version
componentize-py 0.13.5
```

## Install WebAssembly tooling for Worker to Worker communication

Using [Worker to Worker communication](/docs/python-language-guide/rpc) requires **Rust** and **WASM** tooling, because _golem RPC client stubs_ are generated and implemented as _Rust_ components.

<Steps>

    ### Install Rust

    Install rustup

    ```bash copy
    curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
    ```

    Install the latest stable version of Rust

    ```bash copy
    rustup install stable && rustup default stable
    ```

    Add the WASI target

    ```bash copy
    rustup target add wasm32-wasi
    ```

    ### Install `cargo-component`

    The last step is installing the `cargo-component` extension for Rust's `cargo` build tool. This will enable a set of subcommands for `cargo` which allows compiling Rust projects into **WebAssembly components**.

    Install the version `0.13.2` of `cargo-component` with `cargo` itself:

    ```shell
    $ cargo install --force --locked cargo-component@0.13.2
    ```

    Verify that the correct version is installed:

    ```shell
    $ cargo component --version
    cargo-component 0.13.2 (wasi:040ec92)
    ```

    Please refer [to the cargo-component website](http://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component) for more information.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Golem requires a **specific version** of `cargo-component`. Please make sure the correct version
  is installed with the commands described above.
