# Next steps

After [setting up the Python development environment](/docs/python-language-guide/setup) and learning the basic steps [writing a Golem component](/docs/python-language-guide/defining-components) and [building them](docs/python-language-guide/building-components), please consider learning about the following topics:

<Steps>
### Making HTTP requests from a Golem component
Learn how to [send HTTP requests from a Golem component written in Python](/docs/python-language-guide/http).

### Control durability guarantees

Check how the Golem runtime API can [control various durability settings](/docs/python-language-guide/durability) of Golem.

### Automatic retries

Learn about Golem's retry mechanism and [how it can be customized](/docs/python-language-guide/retries).

### Promises

Create and use [promises](/docs/python-language-guide/promises) to await external events from within a running worker.

### Using WASI interfaces

See what low-level [WASI interfaces](/docs/python-language-guide/wasi) are available and how they can be used from Python.

### Call other workers from a worker

[Worker to Worker communication](/docs/python-language-guide/worker-to-worker)
