# Working with Golem Promises in Python

Golem **promises** provide a way for Golem workers to wait on an external condition. The worker creates the promise and somehow sends its identifier to the external system responsible for **completing** the promise. Then the worker can **await** the promise, being suspended until the external system completes the promise using Golem's REST API.

It is also possible to complete a promise from within a Golem worker using the Golem SDK.

When a promise is completed, an arbitrary byte array can be attached to it as a payload - this data is returned to the awaiting worker when is continues execution.

In Python the promise API can be used by directly importing and using the Golem runtime API.

### Adding as a dependency

To use Golem's runtime API, add all the WIT files from https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/main/wit/deps in the project's `wit/deps` directory, and then importing this interface to the component's world:

```wit
world example {
    import golem:api/host@0.2.0;
    // ...
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The `golem-cli new` examples for Python automatically create the `wit/deps` directory for you,
  except the `c-actor-minimal` one.
</Callout>

### Creating a promise

To create a promise simply call the `golem_create_promise` function:

```python
from py_example.imports.host import golem_create_promise

promise_id = golem_create_promise()
```

The returned value, `PromiseId`, is defined as the following:

```python
@dataclass
class Uuid:
    """
    UUID
    """
    high_bits: int
    low_bits: int

@dataclass
class ComponentId:
    """
    Represents a Golem component
    """
    uuid: Uuid

@dataclass
class WorkerId:
    """
    Represents a Golem worker
    """
    component_id: ComponentId
    worker_name: str

@dataclass
class PromiseId:
    """
    A promise ID is a value that can be passed to an external Golem API to complete that promise
    from an arbitrary external source, while Golem workers can await for this completion.
    """
    worker_id: WorkerId
    oplog_idx: int
```

### Deleting a promise

If a promise is no longer used, it has to be deleted with

```python
golem_delete_promise(promise_id);
```

### Awaiting a promise

To await a promise, use the `golem_await_promise` function:

```python
payload = golem_await_promise(promise_id)
```

The resulting `payload` is a byte array (`bytes`) containig the data attached to the promise on completion.

### Completing a promise from within a worker

To complete a promise from within a worker, use the `golem_complete_promise` function:

```python
golem_complete_promise(promise_id, str.encode("hello world"))
```

### Completing a promise from an external source

To see how to use the **promise ID** to complete a promise through the external REST API, check [the REST API documentation](/docs/rest-api).
