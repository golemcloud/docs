# Building Golem Components in Python

Building Golem components written in Python as it is described on the [Building Components page](pages/python-language-guide/building-components) involves two steps:

<Steps>
### Generate the Python bindings from the WIT files

The `bindings` subcommand of the `componentize-py` tool generates the module containing the generated bindings:

```shell
$ componentize-py bindings bindings
```

### Package the Python code into a WASM component

The `componentize` subcommand of the `componentize-py` tool packages the Python code and the Python interpreter into a single WebAssembly component:

```shell
$ componentize-py componentize --help main -o py_example.wasm
```

<Callout type="info">
  Note that the `componentize-py` tool respects the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable, so make sure
  to activate the virtualenv if there are any Python dependencies used by your component.
