# Golem CLI Components

[Golem components](/docs/concepts/components) are WASM components deployed to Golem for execution.

To create, list and update component you can use `golem-cli component` command.

## Component creation

To create a new component, use `component add` command in the following way:

```bash
golem-cli component add --component-name my-component counters.wasm
```

```
New component created with URN urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799, version 0, and size of 89735 bytes.
Component name: my-component.
Exports:
        rpc:counters/api.{[constructor]counter}(name: string) -> handle<0>
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.inc-by}(self: &handle<0>, value: u64)
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.get-value}(self: &handle<0>) -> u64
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.get-args}(self: &handle<0>) -> list<string>
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.get-env}(self: &handle<0>) -> list<tuple<string, string>>
        rpc:counters/api.{inc-global-by}(value: u64)
        rpc:counters/api.{get-global-value}() -> u64
        rpc:counters/api.{get-all-dropped}() -> list<tuple<string, u64>>
        rpc:counters/api.{bug-wasm-rpc-i32}(in: variant { leaf }) -> variant { leaf }
        rpc:counters/api.{[drop]counter}(self: handle<0>)
```

The returned output contains the following information:

- **Component URN** - URN for the new component. You can use this URN whenever you want to specify the component instead of component name.
- **Component version** - incremental component version - used for updating the workers.
- **Component size** - size of the `wasm` file - it is important for the storage limit in the hosted Golem Cloud.
- **Exports** - exported function you can call. You can copy function name (the part before parameters) to call the function. All Golem API expect function names in exactly this format. See the [function name reference page](/docs/function-names) for more details.

## Component search

### Using URN

If you know component URN you can always get the component metadata using `component get --component` command or the top level `get` command:

```bash
golem-cli get urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799
golem-cli component get --component urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799
```

<Callout>
  Note that for referencing any Golem resource, using the `URN` is always the fastest option with
  `golem-cli`.
</Callout>

### Using component name and the latest version

If you want to get the latest version of the component using its name you can either use a URL or `--component-name` option.

For component name `my-component` and the latest version URL would be `component:///my-component` - you can use URL the same way as URN:

```bash
golem-cli get component:///my-component
golem-cli component get --component component:///my-component
```

Alternatively you could use `--component-name` argument this way:

```bash
golem-cli component get --component-name my-component
```

### Using component name and specific version

If you want to get the specific version of the component using its name you can either use a URL or a combination of the `--component-name` and `--version` options.

For component name `my-component` and version `0` URL would be `component:///my-component/0` - you can use URL the same way as URN:

```bash
golem-cli get component:///my-component/0
golem-cli component get --component component:///my-component/0
```

Alternatively you could use `--component-name` argument this way:

```bash
golem-cli component get --component-name my-component --version 0
```

### Getting component list

To get all component versions for specific component name you can use `component list` command with `--component-name` this way:

```bash
golem-cli component list --component-name my-component
```

To get all component available you can use `component list` command this way:

```bash
golem-cli component list
```

<Callout>
  If you want to restrict component search to some specific project on Golem Cloud you can specify
  project via `--project` or `--project-name` option. It works for all commands that accept
  `--component-name` parameter.
</Callout>

## Updating component

To update component you can use `component update` command. This command creates a new version for existing component.
To identify component you can use URN, URL and component name:

```bash
golem-cli component update --component urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799 counters-v1.wasm
golem-cli component update --component component:///my-component counters-v1.wasm
golem-cli component update --component-name my-component counters-v1.wasm
```

If you want to trigger an update all worker to the new latest version right after creating this version you can use `--try-update-workers` option.

## Updating workers

If you want to update all workers you can use `component try-update-workers` command.

This command gets all workers for the component that are not using the latest version and triggers an update for them one by one:

```bash
golem-cli component try-update-workers --component urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799
```

The update request is enqueued and processed by the workers asynchronously, `golem-cli` cannot await for the update to finish.

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that automatic worker update is not guaranteed to succeed, if the updated component differs
  too much from the previous one.
</Callout>

<Callout>You can use URL or `--component-name` instead.</Callout>

## Redeploying workers

During the development of a Golem Component, it is often necessary to quickly rebuild the code, update the component and just restart all the test workers from scratch to test the changes.

This is different from updating the workers as they will loose their state, but it can speed up the feedback loop during development.

This workflow is supported by the `component redeploy` command:

```bash
golem-cli component redeploy --component urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799
```

This command deletes all workers that are not using the latest version of component and re-creates them with the same name, parameters and environment variables.

<Callout>You can use URL or `--component-name` instead.</Callout>
