# Setup development environment for C/C++

To write **Golem components** in C or C++, a couple of common WebAssembly tools need to be installed, as well as the latest version of the **WASM SDK**.

## Install WebAssembly tooling

First of all, to install `wasm-tools` via `cargo`, you need to install the latest stable version of Rust. The recommended way to do so is using [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

<Steps>

### Install Rust

Install rustup

```bash copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Install the latest stable version of Rust

```bash copy
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
```

Add the WASI target

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

### Install `wasm-tools`

```bash copy
cargo install --force --locked  wasm-tools@1.210.0
```

Confirm the installation:

```bash
wasm-tools --version
wasm-tools 1.210.0
```

### Install `wit-bindgen`

```bash copy
cargo install --force --locked wit-bindgen-cli@0.26.0
```

Confirm the installation:

```bash
wit-bindgen --version
wit-bindgen-cli 0.26.0
```

### Install `cargo-component`

The last step is installing the `cargo-component` extension for Rust's `cargo` build tool. This will enable a set of subcommands for `cargo` which allows compiling Rust projects into **WebAssembly components**. This is required for [Worker to Worker communication](/docs/ccpp-language-guide/rpc), because _golem RPC client stubs_ are generated and implemented as _Rust_ components.

Install the version `0.13.2` of `cargo-component` with `cargo` itself:

```shell
$ cargo install --force --locked cargo-component@0.13.2
```

Verify that the correct version is installed:

```shell
$ cargo component --version
cargo-component 0.13.2 (wasi:040ec92)
```

Please refer [to the cargo-component website](http://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component) for more information.

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Golem requires a **specific version** of `wasm-tools`, `wit-bindgen` and `cargo-component`. Please
  make sure the correct version is installed with the commands described above.
</Callout>

## Install WASM SDK 23.0

Download and extract [WASI SDK 23.0](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-23) somewhere - in the examples we assume it is put in `~/wasi-sdk-23.0`.

The SDK contains a version of `Clang` that can compile to WebAssembly modules, which can be converted into Golem components using the `wit-bindgen` and `wasm-tools` command line tools.
