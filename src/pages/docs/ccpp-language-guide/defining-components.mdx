# Defining Golem Components in C

## Creating a project

Golem's **command line interface** provides a set of predefined, Golem-specific **examples** to choose from as a starting point.

To see the available examples for C, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli list-examples --language c
```

<Callout type="info">
  The set of examples provided by Golem CLI is defined in the open-source repository
  [golem-examples](http://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples).
</Callout>

Then to create a new project based on one the default C example, run:

```shell
$ golem-cli new --language c --package-name 'golem:demo' example
```

The command will create a new Golem project in the `example` directory, and print short, language-specific instructions on how to build the project.

## Specification-first approach

Golem and the C/C++ toolchain currently requires defining the component's interface using the **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** format. See [the official documentation of this format](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) for reference.

Each new project generated with `golem-cli` contains a `wit` directory with at least one `.wit` file defining a `world`. This world can contain **exports** (exported functions and interfaces) and these exports will be the compiled Golem component's public API.

The first time a component is compiled (see the [Building Components page](/docs/ccpp-language-guide/building-components) for details), a couple of files (`example.c`, `example.h` and `example_component_type.o` if the component name was `example`) get generated in the `src` directory. This module contains the C definitions of all the data types and interfaces defined in the `WIT` file(s).

To **implement** the specification written in WIT, the C code must implement some of these generated exported functions defined in the generated header file.

### Exporting top-level functions

WIT allows exporting one or more top-level functions in the `world` section, for example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

world example {
    export hello-world: func() -> string;
}
```

To implement this function in C, the following steps must be taken:

- include the generated header `example.h`
- implement the exported function in C

Let's see in code:

```c
// include the generated header
#include "example.h"

// implement the exported function
void example_hello_world(example_string_t *ret) {
    example_string_set(ret, "Hello, World!");
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that in WIT, identifiers are using the `kebab-case` naming convention, while C uses the
  `snake_case` convention. The generated bindings map between the two automatically.
</Callout>

### Exporting interfaces

WIT supports defining and exporting whole _interfaces_, coupling together multiple functions and possibly custom data types.

Take the following example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  add: func(value: u64);
  get: func() -> u64;
}

world example {
  export api;
}
```

This is equivalent to having the two exported functions directly exported from the `world` section, so the implementation in C is once again requires to implement the two exported functions defined in the generated header:

```c

#include "example.h"

// Component state
static uint64_t total = 0;

// Implementation of the exported functions.
void exports_golem_demo_api_add(uint64_t value) {
  total += value;
}

uint64_t exports_golem_demo_api_get() {
  return total;
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  See the **Managing state** section below to learn the recommended way of managing state in Golem
  components, which is required to implement these two functions.
</Callout>

### Exporting resources

The `WIT` format supports defining and exporting **resources** - entities defined by their constructor function and the available methods on them.

Golem supports exporting these resources as part of the worker's API.

The following example modifies the previously seen _counter_ example to define it as a resource, getting the counter's name as a constructor parameter:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  resource counter {
    constructor(name: string);
    add: func(value: u64);
    get: func() -> u64;
  }
}

world example {
  export api;
}
```

Resources can have multiple instances within a worker. Their constructor returns a _handle_ which is then used to call the methods on the resource. Learn more about how resources can be implicitly created and invoked through Golem's APIs in the [Invocations page](/docs/concepts-invocations).

To implement the above defined WIT resource in C a few new steps must be taken:

- define a struct representing the resource - it can contain data!
- implement constructor, methods and destructor for the resource

Let's see in code:

```c
// we need malloc, free and memcpy for the example
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

#include "example.h"

// Define the counter resource's underlying data type
struct exports_golem_demo_api_counter_t {
    example_string_t name;
    uint64_t value;
};

// Implement the constructor that allocates memory for the counter struct and stores the counter's name in it
exports_golem_demo_api_own_counter_t exports_golem_demo_api_constructor_counter(example_string_t *name) {
    exports_golem_demo_api_counter_t* instance = (exports_golem_demo_api_counter_t*)malloc(sizeof(exports_golem_demo_api_counter_t));
    instance->name.len = name->len;
    instance->name.ptr = (uint8_t*)malloc(name->len);
    memcpy(instance->name.ptr, name->ptr, name->len);
    exports_golem_demo_api_own_counter_t own = exports_golem_demo_api_counter_new(instance);
    return own;
}

// Implement the methods
void exports_golem_demo_api_method_counter_add(exports_golem_demo_api_borrow_counter_t self, uint64_t value) {
    self->value += value;
}

uint64_t exports_golem_demo_api_method_counter_get(exports_golem_demo_api_borrow_counter_t self) {
    return self->value;
}

// Implement the destructor
void exports_golem_demo_api_counter_destructor(exports_golem_demo_api_counter_t *rep) {
    example_string_free(&rep->name);
}

```

### Data types defined in WIT

The `WIT` specifications contains some primitive and higher level data types and also allows defining custom data types which can be used as function parameters and return values on the exported functions, interfaces and resources.

The following table shows an example of each `WIT` data type and its corresponding C type:

| WIT type                                       | C type                                                                                                                                                      |

## Worker configuration

It is often required to pass _configuration values_ to workers when they are started.

In general Golem supports three different ways of doing this:

1. Defining a list of string arguments passed to the worker, available as **command line arguments**
2. Defining a list of key-value pairs passed to the worker, available as **environment variables**.
3. Using **resource constructors** to pass configuration values to the worker.

### Command line arguments

The command line arguments associated with the Golem worker can be accessed by calling using the `wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0` WIT interface's `get-arguments` function.

This requires putting the `wit/deps` folder from github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/main/wit/deps in the project's `wit/deps` directory, and then importing this interface to the component's world:

```wit
world example {
    import wasi:cli/environment@0.2.0;
    // ...
}
```

Then from the C code, it can be called as:

```c
example_list_string_t args;
wasi_cli_environment_get_arguments(&args);
```

Command line arguments can only be specified when a worker is **explicitly created** and they are are empty by default, including in cases when the worker was implicitly created by an [invocation](/docs/concepts-invocation).

### Environment variables

Environment variables can be accessed in C using the standard `getenv` function:

```c
printf("KEY=%s\n", getenv("KEY"));
```

Environment variables can be specified when a worker is **explicitly created**, but there are some environment variables that are always set by Golem:

- `GOLEM_WORKER_NAME` - the name of the worker
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_ID` - the ID of the worker's component
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_VERSION` - the version of the component used for this worker

In addition to these, when using [Worker to Worker communication](/docs/pages/rust-language-guide/worker-to-worker-communication), workers created by remote calls **inherit the environment variables of the caller**.

This feature makes environment variables a good fit for passing configuration such as hostnames, ports, or access tokens to trees of workers.

### Resource constructors

As explained earlier, Golem workers can export **resources** and these resources can have **constructor parameters**.

Although resources can be used in many ways, one pattern for Golem is only create a single instance of the exported resource in each worker, and use it to pass configuration values to the worker. This is supported by Golem's worker invocation syntax directly, allowing to implicitly create workers and the corresponding resource by a single invocation as described on the [Invocations page](/docs/concepts-invocations).

## Managing state

Golem workers are **stateful**. There are two major techniques to store and manipulate state in a Golem worker implemented in C:

1. Using global variables
2. Using **resources** and storing state in the resource's struct
