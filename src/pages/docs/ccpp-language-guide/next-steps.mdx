# Next steps

After [setting up the C development environment](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/setup.mdx) and learning the basic steps [writing a Golem component](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/defining-components.mdx) and [building them](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/building-components.mdx), please consider learning about the following topics:

<Steps>
### Making HTTP requests from a Golem component
Learn how to [send HTTP requests from a Golem component written in C/C++](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/http.mdx).

### Control durability guarantees

Check how the Golem runtime API can [control various durability settings](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/durability.mdx) of Golem.

### Automatic retries

Learn about Golem's retry mechanism and [how it can be customized](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/retries.mdx).

### Promises

Create and use [promises](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/promises.mdx) to await external events from within a running worker.

### Using WASI interfaces

See what low-level [WASI interfaces](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/wasi.mdx) are available and how they can be used from C/C++.

### Call other workers from a worker

[Worker to Worker communication](../../docs/ccpp-language-guide/rpc.mdx)
