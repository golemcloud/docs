# Next steps

After [setting up the C development environment](docs/ccpp-language-guide/setup) and learning the basic steps [writing a Golem component](docs/ccpp-language-guide/defining-components) and [building them](docs/ccpp-language-guide/building-components), please consider learning about the following topics:

<Steps>
### Making HTTP requests from a Golem component
Learn how to [send HTTP requests from a Golem component written in C/C++](docs/ccpp-language-guide/http).

### Control durability guarantees

Check how the Golem runtime API can [control various durability settings](docs/ccpp-language-guide/durability) of Golem.

### Automatic retries

Learn about Golem's retry mechanism and [how it can be customized](docs/ccpp-language-guide/retries).

### Promises

Create and use [promises](docs/ccpp-language-guide/promises) to await external events from within a running worker.

### Using WASI interfaces

See what low-level [WASI interfaces](docs/ccpp-language-guide/wasi) are available and how they can be used from C/C++.

### Call other workers from a worker

[Worker to Worker communication](docs/ccpp-language-guide/worker-to-worker)
