# Tier 2 languages

Tier 2 languages can be compiled to WASM **modules** and they support **WASI Preview 1** but there is no way to generate bindings for WIT interfaces.

This restricts them to only expose a single, parameterless `run` function and they can only access the host functionalities part of **WASI Preview 1**. (standard IO, files and filesystems, clock, random, cmd args / environment variables).

It is possible to pass input to these functions using the **standard input** and to get back their **standard output** as the call's results, but this function can only be called once for each worker.

Golem provides two special **calling conventions** for workers implemented with a **tier 2** language:

- The `stdio` calling convention passes the invocation's parameters through the worker's standard input, and parses it's standard output as JSON, returning as the invocation's result. A worker after an `stdio` invocation is no longer usable.

The currently supported Tier 2 languages are:

  <Card title="Swift" href="/docs/building-components/tier-2/swift" />
  <Card title="Grain" href="/docs/building-components/tier-2/grain" />
</Cards>

 Possible other supported Tier 2 languages added in the near future are **Ruby,** **PHP and Haskell**.
