# Tier 1 languages

Tier 1 languages can be either:

- compiled to WASM **modules** their with standard library built on **WASI Preview 1** and there is a **WIT binding** generator available for them
- or compiled directly to WASM **components** supporting **WASI Preview 2**

By supporting WIT bindings Tier 1 languages can take full advantage of Golem's features:

- They can define their own typed interface that can be invoked via Golem
- They can use additional host interfaces such as WASI-HTTP and the Golem Promise API

This makes Tier 1 languages applicable in both **actor-like** and **workflow-like** use cases.

The currently supported Tier 1 languages are:

**JVM** languages like **Java, Scala, Kotlin and Clojure** could in theory be Tier 1 guest languages by using the experimental https://github.com/fermyon/teavm-wasi but it is not working currently. However,
Scala 2 is supported by first compiling to Javascript using Scala.JS and then using the Javascript tooling.

**C#** binding generator is under development, but was not tested with Golem yet.
