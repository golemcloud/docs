# Grain

[Grain](https://grain-lang.org/docs/getting_grain) is a functional language targeting WASM. Its standard library uses WASI Preview 1.

First install `grain` from its official source:

```bash
brew install --no-quarantine --cask grain-lang/tap/grain
```

You also have to install everything as described in [Common tooling](/docs/building-components/common-tooling).

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

Otherwise you can start writing some code, the whole program will be exposed to Golem as a single parameterless `run` function:

```rust
let example1 = (a, b) => {
    print(a)
    print(b)
    a + b
}

print("Hello world!")
example1(100, 10)
```

First we have to compile the `grain` program to WASM:

```bash
grain compile --release main.gr
```

This results in a `main.gr.wasm` file which is a WASM **module**. We cannot write any WIT documents because there is no Grain binding generator available currently. This makes Grain a Tier 2 language, so we can convert the compiled module into a WASM **component** using the adapter from the `tier2` directory of the golem package:

```bash
wasm-tools component new main.gr.wasm -o component.wasm --adapt tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
```

<Callout>Make sure you use the **tier2 adapter** from the golem package!</Callout>

The resulting `component.wasm` is ready to be used with Golem!
