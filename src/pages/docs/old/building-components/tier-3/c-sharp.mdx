# C#

First install the .NET7 SDK package from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0)

You also have to install everything as described in [Common tooling](/docs/building-components/common-tooling).

Then use the `dotnet` CLI tool to create a new package:

```bash
dotnet new console -o csharp-1
dotnet add package Wasi.Sdk --prerelease
```

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

An example program that takes some use of WASI could be the following `Program.cs`:

```csharp
using System.Collections;

var rand = new Random();
var now = DateTime.Now;

Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
Console.WriteLine(rand.NextInt64(0, 1000));
Console.WriteLine(now.Year);
foreach (DictionaryEntry kv in System.Environment.GetEnvironmentVariables()) {
    Console.WriteLine(kv.Key + ": " + kv.Value);
}
```

Build the program into WASM using

```bash
dotnet build
```

The resulting `main.wasm` is a WASM **module** not a component, so we have to use the **tier 2** WASI adapter and `wasm-tools` to convert it to a WASM **component**:

```bash
wasm-tools component new main.wasm -o component.wasm --adapt tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
```

The `wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm` describes the mapping from WASI Preview1 to Preview2. You **must** use the version of this file packaged together with `golem-cli.`

<Callout>Make sure you use the **tier2 adapter** from the golem package!</Callout>

The resulting `component.wasm` is ready to be used with Golem.
