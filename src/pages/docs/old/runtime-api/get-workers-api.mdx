# Get Workers API

The get workers API allows you to get information about the workers for given component.

To use the get workers API, first make sure to add the contents of the `wit/deps` folders from https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit to your own `wit/deps` folder. You can then interact with the get workers interface from your own code in whatever language you are working in.

Our WIT file will look like this:

```wit
package golem:it;

interface api {
  use golem:api/host@0.2.0.{
           component-id,
           worker-metadata
  };
  get-idle-workers: func(component-id: component-id) -> list<worker-metadata>;
}

world workers {
  import golem:api/host@0.2.0;

  export api;
}
```

Now that we have our interface we are ready to implement it. Let's take a look at how we would do that:

```rust
mod bindings;

use crate::bindings::exports::golem::it::api::Guest;
use crate::bindings::golem::api::host::*;

struct Component;

impl Guest for Component {

    fn get_idle_workers(
        component_id: ComponentId
    ) -> Vec<WorkerMetadata> {
        println!(
            "Get idle workers of component: {component_id:?}"
        );
        let filter = Some(WorkerAnyFilter {
            filters: vec![WorkerAllFilter {
                filters: vec![WorkerPropertyFilter::Status(WorkerStatusFilter {
                    comparator: FilterComparator::Equal,
                    value: WorkerStatus::Idle,
                })],
            }]
        });
        let mut workers: Vec<WorkerMetadata> = Vec::new();
        let getter = GetWorkers::new(component_id, filter.as_ref(), true);
        loop {
            match getter.get_next() {
                Some(values) => {
                    workers.extend(values);
                }
                None => break,
            }
        }
        workers
    }
}
```

The `get-idle-workers` function is using the `get-workers` golem-wit resource, which is defined as follows:

```
resource get-workers {
  constructor(component-id: component-id, filter: option<worker-any-filter>, precise: bool);

  get-next: func() -> option<list<worker-metadata>>;
}
```

With `get-workers` resource, our component is able to get workers of provided component with matching filters, `get-next` function will return next chunk of workers, or will return none if there is no more workers.
