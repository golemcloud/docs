# Breaking changes February 2024

The **Golem Cloud February 2024 release**, and the first **Golem Open Source** release contains a couple of breaking changes requiring installation of new tooling and rebuilding/re-uploading the user's projects, as it's core WASM engine was updated to the latest version.

This version uses the **final WASI Preview2** version, released earlier in January 2024.

This page only contains the changes _since the January 2024 release_. Please check the following pages for the previous release notes:

- [January 2024](/docs/release-notes/january-2024.md)
- [August 2023](/docs/release-notes/august-2023.md)

## Update to the latest WASI and component model versions

The WASI interface definitions had breaking changes since the version implemented in earlier Golem Cloud versions, having the following consequences:

- The **required versions of** tooling (depending on the guest language) has been changed. Make sure to install the new versions before compiling any template for Golem Cloud!
- The existing templates **cannot run** on the updated version of Golem Cloud. They need to be recompiled with the new tooling.
- There are some differences in the generated bindings / required settings etc, depending on the used guest language, so the template's source code may have to be updated before recompilation. These differences are collected below.

### Common changes

The WASI interfaces has been updated to the **final Preview2 version**, marked as `0.2.0`.
If you were directly using any of the WASI interfaces, please check the updated definitions in the [golem-wit](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit) repository.

New templates generated with the latest version of `golem-cli` will contain the updated definitions.

Guest languages which are using `wasm-tools` to wrap the WASM module into a WASM component need a new version of `wasm-tools` and the Preview2 adapters.

The required `wasm-tools` version is 1.0.57:

```bash
cargo install  --force --locked wasm-tools@1.0.57
```

The new tier2 and tier3 adapters are in the [golem-wit](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit) repository.

### Rust specific changes

Rust projects now have to use `cargo-component` version `0.7.0`, which comes with some breaking changes as it is documented on [it's release page](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/releases/tag/v0.7.0).

The `cargo-component-bindings` dependency has to be replaced with a `wit-bindgen` dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
wit-bindgen = { version = "0.16.0", default-features = false, features = ["realloc"] }
```

and the `cargo_component_bindings::generate!` macro call with a simple module definition:

```rust
mod bindings;
```

If you are using our `reqwest` fork for HTTP requests, you need to update it to the `update-feb-2024` branch:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { git = "https://github.com/zivergetech/reqwest", branch = "update-feb-2024", features = ["json"] }
```

Beside that you need to update `cargo-component` itself to `0.7.0` as well:

```bash
cargo install --force --locked cargo-component@0.7.0
```

### Javascript and Scala.JS specific changes

The `package.json` file needs to be updated to use the updated version of the `jco` and `componentize-js`:

```json
{
  "devDependencies": {
    "@bytecodealliance/jco": "1.0.0",
    "@bytecodealliance/componentize-js": "0.7.0"
  }
}
```

### Python specific changes

The version of `componentize-py` (`0.11.0`) must be downloaded from [https://github.com/golemcloud/componentize-py/releases/tag/golem-feb-2024
](https://github.com/golemcloud/componentize-py/releases/tag/golem-feb-2024)

### Go specific changes

The `wit-bindgen` tool needs to be updated to a specific revision:

```bash
cargo install wit-bindgen-cli --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen --force --rev 61229eff20fdbc2fe7dac12a269cf7cea24e39d0
```

The `roundtrip.go` HTTP client implementation needs to be updated, the latest code can be found at [https://github.com/golemcloud/go-wasi-http](https://github.com/golemcloud/go-wasi-http).

### C specific changes

The `wit-bindgen` tool needs to be updated to a specific revision:

```bash
cargo install wit-bindgen-cli --git https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen --force --rev 61229eff20fdbc2fe7dac12a269cf7cea24e39d0
```
