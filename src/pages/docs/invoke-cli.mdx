# Invoke using Golem CLI

The `golem-cli` tool exposes two invocation subcommands:

- `golem-cli worker invoke` triggers a function invocation on a worker without waiting for its completion
- `golem-cli worker invoke-and-await` invokes a function on a worker and awaits its result

## Specifying what to invoke

Both commands require specifying which worker to invoke, and the name of the function.

There are multiple options for selecting the worker:

- `--worker urn:worker:<component-id>/<worker-name>`
- `--worker worker:///<component_name>/<worker-name>`
- `--component urn:component:<component-id> --worker-name <worker-name>`
- `--component component:///<component-name> --worker-name <worker-name>`

The function to be invoked is selected by the `--function` parameter. Read the [invocation function name syntax page](function-names) for more information about the possible function names.

## Encoding parameters

The CLI provides three ways to define the invocation **parameters**:

- Passing a JSON array of **typed JSON values** to `--parameters`. This is the same format as used [on the HTTP invocation API](invoke-http).
- Passing a JSON array of **JSON values** only, without type information, to `--parameters`. The format for encoding WebAssembly values in JSON is [described on the JSON WAVE Mapping page](json-wave-mapping). In this case `golem-cli` assumes that the invocation targets the latest version of the selected component, queries it's metadata and uses the selected function's type information for interpreting the provided JSON values.
- Using the [WebAssembly Value Encoding](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) with one or more `--arg` parameter (one for each invocation parameter).

## Getting results

When using `invoke-and-await`, the CLI awaits the result of the invocation and prints the result value to the standard output. By default it uses the `text` format, in which case it prints the result value using the [WebAssembly Value Encoding](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave).

This can be changed with `--format json` or `--format yaml` to print the invocation result in JSON or YAML, using the [mapping described on the JSON WAVE Mapping page](json-wave-mapping).

## Logs

Both invocation commands accept an optional `--connect` flag for conneting to the invoked worker's event stream and showing its logs. This works the same as running a separate `golem-cli worker connect` command during the invocation. The logs consists of everything the worker writes to its standard output and standard error, as well as through the WASI Logging API.

The `--connect` option's output (and also the `connect` subcommand) can be customized with the following parameters:

- `--format text|json|yaml` for different encodings of the log lines
- `--colors=yes|no` to enable/disable colors for the `text` format
- `--show-timestamps=yes|no` to enable/disable showing timestamps for each log line
- `--show-level=yes|no` to enable/disable showing the log level (or stdout/stderr) for each log line
