# C

C and C++ can be used to compile WASM modules using WASI Preview 1 by using https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases.

You also have to install everything as described in [Common tooling](/docs/building-templates/common-tooling).

First download and extract wasi-sdk somewhere - in the examples we assume it is put in `~/wasi-sdk-20.0`.

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you prefer to do it manually from scratch, you first need to create a `wit` directory and a `main.wit` file in it describing your template's interface, and optionally adding additional dependencies in `wit/deps` from the golem package (wasi-http, promise api, etc).

The following example `main.wit` does not use any extra imports but defines two exported functions for your component:

```rust
package my:component

world c-api1 {
    export run: func() -> s32
    export print: func(s: string) -> ()
}
```

Then generate bindings from this WIT using `wit-bindgen`:

```rust
wit-bindgen c ./deps
```

This will generate some `.c`, `.h` and `.o` files. Write a new `main.c` file implementing the functions generated by `wit-bindgen` :

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

#include "c_api1.h"

int32_t main(void) {
    return 0;
}

int32_t c_api1_run(void) {
    printf("Hello World!\n");
    return 100;
}

void c_api1_print(c_api1_string_t *s) {
    char* buf = malloc(s->len + 1);
    memset(buf, 0, s->len + 1);
    strncpy(buf, s->ptr, s->len);

    time_t t = time(NULL);
    struct tm tm = *localtime(&t);

    printf("%s %d\n", buf, tm.tm_year + 1900);
}
```

and compile it to WASM using the `clang` included in `wasi-sdk`:

```bash
~/wasi-sdk-20.0/bin/clang --sysroot ~/wasi-sdk-20.0/share/wasi-sysroot main.c c_api1.c c_api1_component_type.o  -o main.wasm
```

<Callout>Use `~/wasi-sdk-20.0/bin/clang++` if you are using C++ instead</Callout>

The resulting `main.wasm` is a WASM **module** which already has the binary representation of the **WIT** definitions embedded (that's what is in the generated `.o`).

So the only remaining step is to turn this into a WASM **component** using `wasm-tools`:

```bash
wasm-tools component new main.wasm --adapt tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm -o template.wasm
```

The resulting `template.wasm` is ready to be uploaded to Golem!
