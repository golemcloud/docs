# Rust

Make sure you have the latest Rust version installed and have `cargo` in the path. The recommended way to do so is using [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
```

The easiest way to build Golem templates with Rust is using the compatible version of https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component. A prerequisite of `cargo-component` is `protobuf` (at least 15), which can be installed as described on [http://google.github.io/proto-lens/installing-protoc.html](http://google.github.io/proto-lens/installing-protoc.html):

```bash
brew install protobuf
```

Then install the **required version** of `cargo-component`:

```bash
cargo install --force --locked cargo-component@0.5.0
cargo component --version
cargo-component-component 0.5.0 (wasi:6f0da84)
```

  Read the following section if your IDE is not recognizing the generated bindings in Rust projects
  using cargo-component:

</Callout>

<Callout>
  The `cargo` build tool does not know how to build WebAssembly **components alone.** The above
  installed `cargo-component` tool is an extension to it adding a new subset of commands starting
  with `cargo component ...` Using these new commands such as `cargo component build` makes sure the
  compiler toolchain produces a WebAssembly component model target and that all the necessary
  bindings are generated.
</Callout>

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you prefer to set up your project manually, you first need to create a new template:

```bash
cargo component new --reactor golem-test
```

Modify the interface definition for the template in `wit/world.wit`:

```rust
package my:template;

interface api {
  record product-item {
    product-id: string,
    name: string,
    price: float32,
    quantity: u32,
  }

  record order {
    order-id: string,
    items: list<product-item>,
    total: float32,
    timestamp: u64,
  }

  record order-confirmation {
    order-id: string,
  }

  variant checkout-result {
    error(string),
    success(order-confirmation),
  }

  initialize-cart: func(user-id: string) -> ();

  add-item: func(item: product-item) -> ();

  remove-item: func(product-id: string) -> ();

  update-item-quantity: func(product-id: string, quantity: u32) -> ();

  checkout: func() -> checkout-result;

  get-cart-contents: func() -> list<product-item>;
}

world shopping-cart {
  export api;
}
```

The functions exported in the `world` in this file will be exposed by **Golem**.

In the Rust source code you generate and import the exported symbols as:

```rust
cargo_component_bindings::generate!();

use bindings::exports::my::template::api::*;
```

and then implement the `Guest` trait from the interface definition:

```rust
struct Component;

impl Guest for Component {
  fn initialize_cart(user_id: String) {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

The struct you implement the trait for **must be called** `Component`!

### State in Rust

When running a Golem component you don't have to care about concurrent access of global state - each worker based on the template runs completely separated. The worker's state is persisted by Golem so all you have to do for state handling is to store data in a global mutable variable.

In Rust we recommend the following pattern for this:

```rust
struct State {
    user_id: String,
    items: Vec<ProductItem>,
}

static mut STATE: State = State {
    user_id: String::new(),
    items: vec![],
};

fn with_state<T>(f: impl FnOnce(&mut State) -> T) -> T {
    let result = unsafe { f(&mut STATE) };

    return result;
}

// ...

fn add_item(item: ProductItem) {
        with_state(|state| {
            println!(
                "Adding item {:?} to the cart of user {}",
                item, state.user_id
            );

            state.items.push(item);
        });
    }
```

### WASI Preview1 APIs

Rust already support WASI Preview1 so by using its standard libraries to work with IO, file systems, random numbers will automatically work with Golem.

### WASI Preview2 APIs

To use any of the new WASI APIs, you need to explicitly put the WASI interface definitions in the `wit/deps` folder. Use the WASI interface definitions packaged with `golem-cli` to make sure they are compatible with the version implemented by **Golem** as these interfaces are still not finalized.

The dependencies has to be added to the `Cargo.toml` file for `cargo-component`, for example:

```toml
[package.metadata.component.target.dependencies]
"wasi:io" = { path = "wit/deps/io" }
"wasi:http" = { path = "wit/deps/http" }
```

This allows using these WIT packages in your main WIT file, making them available from Rust:

```rust
import wasi:io/poll@0.2.0-rc-2023-11-10;
import wasi:io/streams@0.2.0-rc-2023-11-10;
import wasi:http/types@0.2.0-rc-2023-11-10;
import wasi:http/outgoing-handler@0.2.0-rc-2023-11-10;
```

### HTTP

Golem implements the WASI-HTTP interface so any library built on that could be used from Golem components to communicate with external services.

At the time of writing the only library available is our fork of `reqwest`

To use it, just add the following dependency to your component's `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
reqwest = { git = "https://github.com/golemcloud/reqwest", branch = "update-jan-2024", features = ["json"] }
```

There is no need to manually add the WASI-HTTP interfaces to your `wit/deps` folder.

The fork provides the same API as the official `reqwest` blocking API, so please use the library's documentation for more information: [https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/)

### Compiling Rust

Creating the Golem template is just running:

```bash
cargo component build --release
```

The output is `target/wasm32-wasi/release/component_name.wasm` and it is ready to be uploaded to **Golem Cloud.** (the output file's name depends on the project!)
