# Python

Python programs can be compiled into WASM components using the tool `componentize-py`. For **Golem** you should use our forked version of this tool, as it pins all its dependencies to the one required by Golem Cloud.

Download a prebuilt `0.7.1` binary from the following address:

https://github.com/golemcloud/componentize-py/releases/tag/canary-golem

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you prefer to do it manually, first create a WIT interface definition in your project's `wit` directory:

```rust
package my:component

interface api {
  add: func(value: u64)
  get: func() -> u64
}

world component-name {
  export api
}
```

The next step is to generate the Python bindings from this interface description using `componentize-py`:

```rust
componentize-py bindings bindings
```

The second parameter here is the **name** of the Python module to be generated. This module will contain all the types described in the interface description, as well as **base classes** to implement the exported functions.

Let's implement the two exported function in a `[main.py](http://main.py)` file:

```python
from bindings.component_name import exports

state: int = 0

class Api(exports.Api):
    def add(self, value: int):
      global state
      print("add " + str(value))
      state = state + value

    def get(self) -> int:
       global state
       print("get")
       return state
```

The name of the class **must be** `Api`! The base class is imported from the generated `bindings` module's submodule which is named as the **world** in your WIT file. If you are not sure what name to use, check the generated bindings, in this case in `bindings/exports/__init__.py`.

The last step is to compile the Python program to a WASM component using `componentize-py`:

```python
componentize-py componentize main -o my-template.wasm
```

The resulting `my-template.wasm` is ready to be uploaded to **Golem Cloud**!
