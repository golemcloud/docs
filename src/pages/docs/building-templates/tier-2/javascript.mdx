# JavaScript

JavaScript can be used as a Tier 2 guest language using https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-js.

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you prefer doing it from scratch, start with a npm `package.json` like this:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "devDependencies": {
    "@bytecodealliance/jco": "0.14.1",
    "@bytecodealliance/componentize-js": "0.5.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node componentize.js"
  }
}
```

Run `npm install` to download the required tooling:

```bash
npm install
```

Then add the following build script called `componentize.js` to your project:

```jsx
import { componentize } from "@bytecodealliance/componentize-js"
import { readFile, writeFile, mkdir } from "node:fs/promises"
import { resolve } from "node:path"

const jsSource = await readFile("main.js", "utf8")

const { component } = await componentize(jsSource, {
  witPath: resolve("wit"),
  enableStdout: true,
  preview2Adapter: "adapters/tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm",
})

await mkdir("out", { recursive: true })
await writeFile("out/component_name.wasm", component)
```

The `adapters/tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm` to be used can be downloaded from the `golem-wit` repository: [https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/blob/main/adapters/tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/blob/main/adapters/tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm)

<Callout>
When using `golem new` to generate the project, the correct version of the adapter WASM is automatically put in the project's directory.

</Callout>

The next step is to define your worker template's interface using a WIT file:

```jsx
package golem:component;

interface api {
  add: func(value: u64);
  get: func() -> u64;
}

world demo  {
  export api;
}
```

Put it in a file in the `wit` subdirectory, for example `wit/main.wit`

If needed you can put additional WIT files from [https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/main/wit/deps](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/main/wit/deps) to the `wit/deps` directory in your project, and import them to your main interface definition.

Finally write a JS file implementing the interface defined in the WIT file:

```jsx
var state = 0

export const api = {
  add: function (value) {
    console.log(`Adding ${value} to the counter`)
    state += Number(value)
  },
  get: function () {
    console.log(`Returning the current counter value: ${state}`)
    return BigInt(state)
  },
}
```

Running the build script with

```jsx
npm run build
```

produces a WASM file in the `out` directory ready to be uploaded to Golem!
