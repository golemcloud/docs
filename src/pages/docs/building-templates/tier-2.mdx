# Tier 2 languages

Tier 2 languages can be compiled to WASM **modules** their standard library is built on **WASI Preview 1** and there is a **WIT binding** generator available for them.

Using the binding generator Tier 2 languages can take full advantage of Golem's features:

- They can define their own typed interface that can be invoked via Golem
- They can use additional host interfaces such as WASI-HTTP and the Golem Promise API

This makes Tier 2 languages applicable in both **actor-like** and **workflow-like** use cases.

The currently supported Tier 2 languages are:

  <Card title="Go" href="/docs/building-templates/tier-2/c" />

</Cards>

 **Zig** may be lifted to be a Tier 2 guest language in the near future, as it is supposed to work with bindings generated for C.

**JVM** languages like **Java, Scala, Kotlin and Clojure** could in theory be Tier 2 guest languages by using the experimental https://github.com/fermyon/teavm-wasi but it is not working currently.
