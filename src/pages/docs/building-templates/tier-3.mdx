# Tier 3 languages

Tier 3 languages can be compiled to WASM **modules** and they support **WASI Preview 1** but there is no way to generate bindings for WIT interfaces.

This restricts them to only expose a single, parameterless `run` function and they can only access the host functionalities part of **WASI Preview 1**. (standard IO, files and filesystems, clock, random, cmd args / environment variables).

It is possible to pass input to these functions using the **standard input** and to get back their **standard output** as the call's results, but this function can only be called once for each worker.

Golem provides two special **calling conventions** for workers implemented with a **tier 3** language:

- The `stdio` calling convention passes the invocation's parameters through the worker's standard input, and parses it's standard output as JSON, returning as the invocation's result. A worker after an `stdio` invocation is no longer usable.
- The `stdio-eventloop` calling convention makes it possible to implement stateful workers with a **tier 3** language but it requires the worker to be implemented as a **loop** that in each iteration reads a single line containing the invocation parameters as JSON, and before reading the next line is responsible to write the response to the standard output as a single-line JSON.

The currently supported Tier 3 languages are:

 Possible other supported Tier 3 languages added in the near future are **Ruby,** **PHP and Haskell**.
