# Zig

Install the latest version (**0.11**) of **Zig** (for example `brew install zig`).

You also have to install everything as described in [Common tooling](/docs/building-templates/common-tooling).

Currently we consider **Zig** a **Tier 3** guest language, which means we cannot use any WIT interface definitions for it and can only call the Zig program's `main` function exposed as a parameterless `run` function for Golem.

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you prefer to do it from scratch, first write a Zig program that has a `main` function `src/main.zig`:

```rust
pub fn main() anyerror!void {
  // ...
}
```

Create a Zig build file that targets WASM and WASI:

```rust
const std = @import("std");
const Builder = std.build.Builder;
const CrossTarget = std.zig.CrossTarget;

pub fn build(b: *Builder) void {
    const optimize = b.standardOptimizeOption(.{
        .preferred_optimize_mode = .ReleaseSmall,
    });

    const exe = b.addExecutable(.{
        .name = "main",
        .root_source_file = .{ .path = "src/main.zig" },
        .target = .{
            .cpu_arch = .wasm32,
            .os_tag = .wasi,
        },
        .optimize = optimize
    });
    b.installArtifact(exe);
}
```

Then build the WASM module with:

```bash
zig build
```

The resulting WASM file in `zig-out/bin/main.wasm` is just a WASM **module**, not ready to be used with **Golem.**

Then we have to convert the module to a WASM component, including mapping its WASI Preview1 imports into WASI Preview2 imports.

This is done with `wasm-tools`:

```bash
wasm-tools component new zig-out/bin/main.wasm -o template.wasm --adapt tier3/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
```

The `wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm` describes the mapping from WASI Preview1 to Preview2. You **must** use the version of this file packaged together with `golem-cli.`

<Callout>Make sure you use the **tier3 adapter** from the golem package!</Callout>

The resulting `template.wasm` is ready to be used with **Golem**.
