# Rib

**Rib** is the language used by the [Worker Gateway](/docs/concepts/worker-gateway) that enables users to write programs capable of manipulating worker responses, which are WebAssembly (WASM) values.

Rib uses the [WAVE (WebAssembly Value Encoding)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) syntax for encoding values.

## Rib Grammar

`rib-expr` below defines the grammar of **Rib**.

number_type_suffix ::= "s8"|"s16"|"s32"|"s64"|"u8"|"u16"|"u32"|"u64"|"f32"|"f64"

```

The following sections show some examples of each construct.

## Examples

Note that Rib expressions in the below examples need to be wrapped in code block using `${` `}`. This is to differentiate between raw text and an actual Rib program.
As we progress, we may try to avoid the need of it, and being able to write `Rib` program in IDE without code-blocks.
Example: `${1}` is evaluated as a `Number` while `1` is evaluated as text.

Rib scripts can be multiline, and it should be separated by `;`. The last expression in the Rib script is the return value of the script.

### Numbers

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

1
```

However, most of the time you need to specify the type of the number as it can be u8, u16, f32 or any of the WASM types representing numbers.

Example:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
1f64
```

Another way to annotate type is

```
let x: f64 = 1;
```

This is a parsed as a number of type u64. Similarly `-1` is parsed as a number of type i64 and `1.1` is parsed as a number of type f64.

### String

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

"Hello"
```

This is parsed as a string literal. If the strings are not wrapped with quotes, then it is considered as a variable.

### Boolean

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
true
```

This is parsed as a boolean true. Similarly `false` is parsed as a boolean literal.

### Variables

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
foo
```

This is parsed as a `Rib` variable expression and evaluating such an expression can fail if the value of this variable is not available in the context of evaluation.
Usually `variables` are used to refer to the values in the context of evaluation. The context can mostly be `let binding` or `pattern matching` or `request` or `worker` or `response` etc.

More explanations on variables can be found in other examples.

### Sequence

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Sequence of numbers
[1, 2, 3]
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Sequence of strings
["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Sequence of record
[{a: "foo"}, {b : "bar"}]
```

This is parsed as a sequence of values. While the values can be of any type, similar to any dynamic language, evaluation may fail with error if we mix different types in a sequence.
In other words, `Rib` evaluator do expect the values in a sequence to be of the same type.

### Record

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

{ name: "John", age: 30u32 }
{ city: "New York", population: 8000000u64 }
{ country: "France", capital: "Paris" }
{ fruits: ["apple"", "banana"", "orange""], count: 3u32 }

```

This is parsed as a `WASM` Record. The syntax is inspired from `WASM-WAVE`. The minor difference here is strings are wrapped with single quotes instead of double quotes.
Note that keys are not considered as variables. They are considered as literals (even in the absence of single quotes) if they are part of Record.

### Tuple

```
(1u8, 100u32, 20.1f32)
```

This is also equivalent to the following in Rib.

```
let k: (u8, u32, f32) = (1, 100, 20.1);
k
```

This is parsed as a tuple of values. Unlike `sequence`, the values in a tuple can be of different types.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
("foo", 1, {a: "bar"})
```

### Flags

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{ Foo, Bar, Baz }
```

This is parsed as Flag type in WASM. The values are separated by comma.

### Selection of Field

A field can be selected from an `Rib` expression if it is a `Record` type. For example, `foo.user`
is a valid selection given `foo` is a variable that gets evaluated to a record value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{ name: "John", age: 30u16 }.name
```

### Selection of Index

This is selecting an index from a sequence value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
[1, 2, 3][0]
```

For example `foo[10]` is valid given `foo` is an `Rib` variable that gets evaluated to a sequence.

### Request and selection of Fields

If using worker-bridge of golem OSS, you can use the variable `request` as this is available in the runtime context of Rib in worker-bridge
that points to the input request.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
request
```

To select the body field in request,

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

request.body
```

Note that Rib infers types of the values only if the value is being passed to a worker function, where in it looks up the component metadata.
However, in situations where you have a standalone script such as `request.body`, it cannot infer the types and fail to compile. The best way
to fix this and ensure there are no compile time errors is to annotate it the type.

```
let x: str = request.body;
x

```

Say the request body is a `record` in Json, as given below. `Rib` sees it as a `WASM` Record type.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{
  "user": "Alice",
  "age": 30u32
}
```

Then we can use Rib language to select the field `user`, as it considers this request's body as a `WASM` Record type.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let x: str = request.body.user;
x
```

### Invoke Worker Functions using Rib

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let worker_result = worker_function_name(request.body);
worker_result
```

If the worker response is a record, then we can select the field in the response as follows

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 {
  "user": "Alice",
  "age": 30u32
}

```

Then we can use Rib language to select the field `user`, as it considers the value of `worker.response` `WASM` Record type, and therefore a valid selection.

### Result

`Result`in `Rib` is WASM Result, which can take the shape of `ok` or `err`. This is similar to `Result` type in std `Rust`.

A `Result` can be `Ok` of a value, or an `Err` of a value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 ok(1)
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 err("error")
```

This is again, using the same syntax followed in wasm-wave.
A worker's response can be at times a `Result` type, where it can either `ok(x)` or `err(y)`
and if we use `Rib` language to peek/unwrap this result.

This can exist anywhere. If needed, user can embed a result in the request body and worker-bridge consider them to be a `Result` within the Record.
More on these details can be found under worker-bridge's documentation

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

{
  "user": "ok(Alice)",
  "age": 30u32
}
```

### Option Expr

`Option` in corresponding to WASM , which can take the shape of `Some` or `None`. This is similar to `Option` type in std `Rust`.

An `Option` can be `Some` of a value, or `None`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 some(1)
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 none
```

The syntax is inspired from wasm wave.

### Comparison Operators

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
5 > 3

```

The left side rib expression is evaluated as a Number 5, and the right side rib expression is evaluated as a Number 3.
The comparison operator `>` is used to compare the two numbers, resulting in `true`.

Similarly, we can use other comparison operators like `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `<` etc.
Both operands should be a valid Rib code that points/evaluated to a number or string.

Trying to compare complex values will result in evaluation error. Example : `[1, 2, 3] > [4, 5, 6]` will result in error.
We will add support for these in Expr language.

### Conditional Statement

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

 let id: u32 = request.user.id;
 if id > 3 then "higher" else "lower"

```

The structure of the conditional statement is `if <condition> then <then-rib-expr> else <else-rib-expr>`,
where `condition-expr` is an expr that should get evaluated to boolean.
The `then-rib-expr` or `else-rib-expr` can be an any valid rib code, which could be another `if else` itself

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

 let id: u32 = request.user.id;
 if id > 3 then "higher" else if id == 3 then "equal" else "lower"

```

If branch and then branch are not type checked as of now.
Meaning similar to other dynamic languages like python, they may get evaluated to different types of WASM values.

### Pattern Matching

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

match <expr> {
    <pattern> => <expr>,
    <pattern> => <expr>
}

```

Here are few examples that gives you an idea of what can be done with the current support of pattern matching.
This would probably be your go-to construct when you are dealing with complex data structures like `Result` or `Option` or other custom `variant` (WASM Variant)
that comes out as worker.response.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  let worker_result = my_worker_function_name(1, "jon");
  match worker_result { ok(x) => "foo", err(msg) => "error" }
```

You can bring them in multiple lines as follows:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  match worker_result {
    ok(x) => "foo",
    err(msg) => "error"
  }
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  match worker.response {
    some(x) => "found",
    none => "not found"
  }
```

Say your worker responded with a `variant`.
Note on variant: A variant statement defines a new type where instances of the type match exactly one of the variants listed for the type.
This is similar to a "sum" type in algebraic datatype (or an enum in Rust if you're familiar with it).
Variants can be thought of as tagged unions as well.

Let's say we have a variant of type as given below responded from the `worker`. The `worker-bridge` is aware of the type
of response from the `worker`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
variant my_variant {
    bar( {a: u32,b: string }),
    foo(list<string>),
}
```

#### Variables in the context of pattern matching

In all of the above, there exist a variable in the context of pattern.
Example `x` in `ok(x)` or `msg` in `err(msg)` or `x` in `some(x)` or `x` in `bar(x)` or `x` in `foo(x)`.

These variables are bound to the value that is being matched.

Example, given the worker response is ok(1), the following match expression will result in `2`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
   let result = my-worker-function("foo");

   match result {
    ok(x) => x + 1,
    err(msg) => 0
  }
```

The following match expression will result in "c", if the worker response was variant value `foo(["a", "b", "c"])`,
and will result in "a" if the `worker.response` was variant value `bar({a: 1, b: "a"})`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  let result = my-worker-function();

  match result {
    bar(x) => x.b,
    foo(x) => x[1]
  }

```

More on let binding below

#### Wild card patterns

In some of the above examples, the binding variables are unused. In this case, we can use `_` as a wildcard pattern to indicate that we don't care about the value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  match worker.response {
    bar(_) => "bar",
    foo(_) => "foo"
  }
```

### Let Binding

We have already seen `let` binding in the above examples. Here is another simple example of `let` binding.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

 let a = { age: worker.response.age, city: "New York", name: request.body.name };

 match worker.response.admin {
   Admin(_) => "admin",
   User(x) => a
 }

```

Or even as simple as:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

  let x = { a : 1u32 };
  let y = { b : 2u32 };
  let z = x.a > y.b;
  z

```

The return value of the script is the last expression in the script, and is of the type boolean.

## Known issues and Limitations

Rib has become a typed script as part of 1.0 release, and is probably the newest entry into the whole ecosystem of Golem.
We are making great improvements in this space and there will be constant release especially in the space of Rib.

Following are some known issues and how to fix them if you encounter them

- Stack overflow when inlining record or nested complex expressions. The solution is to use let binding expressions and use variables instead of inlining records.

```
let d: str = request.path.id;
let x = { a: 1u32, b: 2u32, c: d };
call(x)

```

- Incomplete syntax errors. We are working on this. For the most part a syntax (parser errors) comes from the following:

  - Missing semicolon at the end of the every Rib statement.
  - Adding a semicolon at the end of the last line in your Rib script. Rib will fail to compile in this case.
  - Missing closing curly braces.
  - Missing closing square brackets
  - Missing comma in sequence elements.
  - Invalid function names.

- Complex compiler error messages. We are working on this
- Compiler errors occur when you don't specify the type of numbers. Example `1` will fail whil `1u8` will not. This is because Rib is typed and is trying to infer a proper WASM type. We will see how to improve this.
