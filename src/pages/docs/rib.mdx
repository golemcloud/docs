# Rib

**Rib** is the language used by the [Worker Gateway](concepts/worker-gateway) that enables users to write programs capable of manipulating worker responses, which are WebAssembly (WASM) values.

Rib uses the [WAVE (WebAssembly Value Encoding)](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/tree/main/crates/wasm-wave) syntax for encoding values.

## Rib Grammar

`rib-expr` below defines the grammar of **Rib**.

```

The following sections show some examples of each construct.

## Examples

Rib scripts can be multiline, and it should be separated by `;`.

### Return type of a Rib script

The last expression in the Rib script is the return value of the script. The last line in Rib script
shouldn't end with a `;`, as this is a syntax error.

### Numbers

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
1u16
```

Most of the time you need to specify the type of the number as it can be u8, u16, f32 or any of the WASM types representing numbers.

Another way to annotate type is

```
let x: f64 = 1;
```

This is a parsed as a number of type u64. Similarly `-1` is parsed as a number of type i64 and `1.1` is parsed as a number of type f64.

Sometimes, you may not need to explicitly specify the type if you are passing the variable to a function
that expects a specific number type. In this case, Rib can infer the types. Otherwise, you need to explicitly mention it.

### String

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

"Hello"
```

This is parsed as a string literal.
If the strings are not wrapped with quotes, then it is considered as a identifier.

### Boolean

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
true
```

This is parsed as a boolean true. Similarly `false` is parsed as a boolean literal.

### Variable identifier

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
foo
```

This is parsed as a `Rib` variable expression and evaluating such an expression can fail if the value of this variable is not available in the context of evaluation.
This implies, if you are running Rib specifying a wasm `component` through `worker-gateway` in `golem`, then `Rib` has the access to look at component metadata.
If `Rib` finds this variable `foo` in the component metadata,then it tries to infer its types.

If such a variable is not present in the wasm component (i.e, you can cross check this in WIT file of the component),
then technically there are two possibilities. Rib will choose to fail the compilation or consider it as a global variable input.
A global input is nothing but `Rib` expects `foo` to be passed in to the evaluator of Rib script (somehow).
Since you are using `Rib` from the worker-gateway part of `golem` the only valid global variable supported is `request` and nothing else.
This would mean, it will fail compilation.

### Sequence

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Sequence of numbers
[1, 2, 3]
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Sequence of strings
["foo", "bar", "baz"]
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Sequence of record
[{a: "foo"}, {b : "bar"}]
```

This is parsed as a sequence of values. While the values can be of any type, similar to any dynamic language, evaluation may fail with error if we mix different types in a sequence.
In other words, `Rib` evaluator do expect the values in a sequence to be of the same type.

### Record

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

{ name: "John", age: 30u16 }

{ city: "New York", population: 8000000u64 }

{ name: "John", age: 30u16, { country: "France", capital: "Paris" } }
```

This is parsed as a `WASM` Record. The syntax is inspired from `WASM-WAVE`.

Note that keys are not considered as variables.
They are considered as literal strings (representing key name of a record element), even in the absence of quotes.

Why age is `30u16` instead of `30` ? If Rib infers the overall type of record (from the context), then you may not need to explicitly specify the type of `30` in the above example.
However most of the times, you will need to specify the number types. We will try to be improve this part of Rib
by providing some flexibility.

### Tuple

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
(1u8, 100u32, 20.1f32)
```

This is also equivalent to the following in Rib.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let k: (u8, u32, f32) = (1, 100, 20.1);
k
```

This is parsed as a tuple of values. Unlike `sequence`, the values in a tuple can be of different types.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
("foo", 1, {a: "bar"})
```

### Flags

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{ Foo, Bar, Baz }
```

This is parsed as Flag type in WASM. The values are separated by comma.

### Selection of Field

A field can be selected from an `Rib` expression if it is a `Record` type. For example, `foo.user`
is a valid selection given `foo` is a variable that gets evaluated to a record value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let foo = { name: "John", age: 30u16 };
foo.name
```

You can also inline as given below:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{ name: "John", age: 30u16 }.name
```

### Selection of Index

This is selecting an index from a sequence value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let x = [1, 2, 3];
x[0]
```

You can also inline as given below

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
[1, 2, 3][0]
```

### Request and selection of Fields

If you are using worker-gatway to upload API definitions, you can use the variable `request` in your Rib script,
and that will be considered as a global input. `worker-gateway` will ensure to pass the value of `request` to the
rib evaluator internally.

Please refer to worker-gateway documents for more details.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
request
```

To select the body field in request,

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

request.body
```

To select a header from the request

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

request.headers

```

To select the value of a path or query variable in your http request.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
request.path.user

```

Please note that Rib by itself don't support a keyword such as `request`, or `path` or `body` or `headers`.
However these values are fed by the worker gateway. Please refer to worker-gateway documentations for more details.

### Type Inference with Request Variables

Note that Rib infers types of the values only if the value is being passed to a worker function directly or indirectly. This is
because Rib knows the argument types of a worker function and it can infer the values based on these types.

However, in situations where you have a standalone script such as `request.body`, it cannot infer the types and it will fail to compile. The best way
to fix the compil time errors is to annotate it the type.

```
let x: string = request.body;
x

```

Say the request body is a `record` in Json, as given below. `Rib` sees it as a `WASM` Record type.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{
  "user": "Alice",
  "age": 30u32
}
```

Then we can use Rib language to select the field `user`, as it considers this request's body as a `WASM` Record type.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let x: string = request.body.user;
x
```

### Invoke Worker Functions using Rib

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let worker_result = worker_function_name(request.body);
worker_result
```

If the worker response is a record, then we can select the field in the response as follows

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 {
  "user": "Alice",
  "age": 30u32
}

```

Then we can use Rib language to select the field `user`, as it considers the value of `worker.response` `WASM` Record type, and therefore a valid selection.

### Result

`Result`in `Rib` is WASM Result, which can take the shape of `ok` or `err`. This is similar to `Result` type in std `Rust`.

A `Result` can be `Ok` of a value, or an `Err` of a value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 ok(1)
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 err("error")
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

{
  "user": "ok(Alice)",
  "age": 30u32
}
```

### Option Expr

`Option` in corresponding to WASM , which can take the shape of `Some` or `None`. This is similar to `Option` type in std `Rust`.

An `Option` can be `Some` of a value, or `None`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 some(1)
```

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 none
```

The syntax is inspired from wasm wave.

### Comparison Operators

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let x: u8 = 1;
let y: u8 = 2;
x + y

```

### Math operations

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let x: u8 = 1;
let y: u8 = 2;
x + y
```

Similarly, we can use other comparison operators like `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `<` etc.
Both operands should be a valid Rib code that points/evaluated to a number or string.

### Conditional Statement

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

 let id: u32 = 10;
 if id > 3 then "higher" else "lower"

```

The structure of the conditional statement is `if <condition> then <then-rib-expr> else <else-rib-expr>`,
where `condition-expr` is an expr that should get evaluated to boolean.
The `then-rib-expr` or `else-rib-expr` can be an any valid rib code, which could be another `if else` itself

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

 let id: u32 = request.user.id;
 if id > 3 then "higher" else if id == 3 then "equal" else "lower"

```

You must ensure that the branches (then branch and else branch) resolve to the same type. Otherwise, Rib
will fail to compile.

### Pattern Matching

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

let res: result<str, str> = ok("foo");

match res {
    ok(v) => v,
    err(msg) => msg
}

```

This would probably be your go-to construct when you are dealing with complex data structures like `result` or `option` or other custom `variant` (WASM Variant)
that comes out as the response of a worker function

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  let worker_result = my_worker_function_name(1, "jon");
  match worker_result {
     ok(x) => "foo",
     err(msg) => "error"
  }
```

### Exhaustive pattern matching

If the pattern match is not exhaustive, then it will throw compilation errors

Example: The following pattern matching is invalid

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  match worker_result {
    some(x) => "found",
  }
```

This will result in following error:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
Error: Non-exhaustive pattern match. The following patterns are not covered: `none`.
To ensure a complete match, add these patterns or cover them with a wildcard (`_`) or an identifier.
```

Now, let's say your worker responded with a `variant`.
Note on variant: A variant statement defines a new type where instances of the type match exactly one of the variants listed for the type.
This is similar to a "sum" type in algebraic datatype (or an enum in Rust if you're familiar with it).
Variants can be thought of as tagged unions as well.

### Pattern Match on Variants

Given you are using Rib through worker bridge, which knows about component metadata,
then, let's say we have a variant of type as given below responded from the `worker`, when invoking a function called `foo`:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
variant my_variant {
    bar( {a: u32,b: string }),
    foo(list<string>),
}
```

then, the following will work:

```
let x = foo("abc");

match x {
  bar({a: _, b: _}) => "success",
  foo(some_list) => some_list[0]
}

```

#### Variables in the context of pattern matching

In all of the above, there exist a variable in the context of pattern.
Example `x` in `ok(x)` or `msg` in `err(msg)` or `x` in `some(x)` or `x` in `bar(x)` or `x` in `foo(x)`.

These variables are bound to the value that is being matched.

Example, given the worker response is ok(1), the following match expression will result in `2`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
   let result = my-worker-function("foo");

   match result {
    ok(x) => x + 1,
    err(msg) => 0
  }
```

The following match expression will result in "c", if the worker response was variant value `foo(["a", "b", "c"])`,
and will result in "a" if the `worker.response` was variant value `bar({a: 1, b: "a"})`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  let result = my-worker-function();

  match result {
    bar(x) => x.b,
    foo(x) => x[1]
  }

```

#### Wild card patterns

In some of the above examples, the binding variables are unused. We can use `_` as a wildcard pattern to indicate that we don't care about the value.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
  match worker.response {
    bar(_) => "bar",
    foo(_) => "foo"
  }
```

### Let Binding

We have already seen `let` binding in the above examples. Here is another set of examples.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

 let worker_response = foo("bar");
 let a = { age: 10u8, city: "New York", name: "foo" };

 match worker_response {
   Admin(_) => {age: "**",  city: "***", name: "***" },
   User(x) => a
 }

```

Or even as simple as:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

  let x = { a : 1u32 };
  let y = { b : 2u32 };
  let z = x.a > y.b;
  z

```

### List Comprehension

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
 let x = ["foo", "bar"];

   for p in x {
     yield p;
   }
```

### List Aggregation

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let ages: list<u16> = [1, 2, 3];

reduce z, a in ages from 0 {
  yield z + a;
}
```

As mentioned above, return value of the script is the last expression in the script, and in this case, it is of the type boolean.

## Known issues and Limitations

Rib has become a typed script as part of 1.0 release, and is probably the newest entry into the whole ecosystem of Golem.
We are making great improvements in this space and there will be constant release especially in the space of Rib.

- Incomplete syntax errors. We are working on this. For the most part a syntax (parser errors) comes from the following:

  - Missing semicolon at the end of the every Rib statement.
  - Adding a semicolon at the end of the last line in your Rib script. Rib will fail to compile in this case.
  - Missing closing curly braces.
  - Missing closing square brackets
  - Missing comma in sequence elements.
  - Invalid function names.

- Complex compiler error messages. We are working on this
- Compiler errors occur when you don't specify the type of numbers. Example `1` will fail whil `1u8` will not. This is because Rib is typed and is trying to infer a proper WASM type. We will see how to improve this.
