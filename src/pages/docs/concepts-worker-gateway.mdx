# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliabile distributed systems.

Golem is highly scalable, and partitions [workers](#concepts-workers.mdx) across
many worker executor nodes, which are each in charge of running a different
subset of workers.

Although partitioning workers across many nodes provides the benefit of
horizontal scalability, it makes it more difficult to know which node is
executing a particular worker.

Even if you know which node is executing a worker, it would not be convenient to
interact with the node directly, because it could fail, and you would have to
implement logic that detects failure and waits until the worker is recovered on
a new node before retrying the invocation.

Moreover, the native protocol for [invoking](#concepts-invocation.mdx) workers
is low-level and inflexible, and most developers will not want to expose the
invocation API to the outside world or to front-end applications.

In order to address these issues, Golem has a _Worker Gateway_ service, which is
effectively stateless and scaled independently of worker executor nodes.

The primary functions of the _Worker Gateway_ are as follows:

1. Identify the node that is responsible for executing the worker being invoked,
   and route the invocation request to the node.
2. Transparently handle executor node failures by detecting failure, awaiting
   recovery, and retrying the invocation.
3. Support the execution of custom APIs, which satisfy arbitrary business and
   technical requirements.

To learn more about how the Worker Gateway supports custom APIs, you can read
the high-level [introduction to _API Definitions_](#concepts-api-definitions.mdx),
which links to further references.
