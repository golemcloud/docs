# Golem CLI

Golem CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with Golem. Golem CLI allows users to upload their components, launch new workers based on these components and call functions on running workers.

## Select appropriate binary

There are 3 different Golem CLI binaries with the same commands.

- Universal `golem-cli` that supports both open sourse and hosted versions of Golem.
- Opens ource specific `golem-cli` without support for the hosted version of Golem.
- `golem-cloud-cli` without support for the open source version of Golem.

<Callout type="info">
  The universla Golem CLI includes all the functionality of the open source specific Golem CLI and
  Golem Cloud CLI. For these examples we will use universal `golem-cli` unless specified otherwise.
</Callout>

## The main functions of the CLI are:

- creating new projects from components
- uploading a new component
- launching new workers based on these components
- invoking functions on workers
- connecting to workers to see their logs
- CLI profile configuration

## Secondary functions of the tool are:

- authentication
- creating projects and organizing components into projects
- managing permissions for projects and accounts
- managing (transferring) ownership of projects

<Callout type="info">These functions are specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

## CLI profile configuration

### Interactive profile configuration

To create default profile use the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli init
```

There are 2 main options: `Golem` - for the standalone open source installation and `Golem Cloud` - for the hosted version of Golem.

Additional `Golem Default` option is pre-configurad profile for default docker compose installation. You can use this option if you are running golem locally via docker compose with default `.env` file.

You can also creade a named profile this way:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli profile init my-profile-name
```

### Non-interact profile configuration

You can manage profiles via `profile` command.

This allows you to switch between your open source Golem installation and the hosted version of Golem.

#### Profile creation

<Callout type="info">You can skip profile creation if you are using `golem-cloud-cli`.</Callout>

Creating a profile (with the name `Cloud`) for the hosted version of Golem:

```bash
$ golem-cli profile add --set-active golem-cloud Cloud
Profile created
```

<Callout type="info">
  Profile creation is the only commad that is incompatible across different CLI binaries.
  {/* prettier-ignore */}
  You have to specify profile type (`golem` or `golem-cloud`) only for the universal `golem-cli`.
</Callout>

Creating a profile (with the name `Cloud`) for the hosted version of Golem using `golem-cloud-cli`:

```bash
$ golem-cloud-cli profile add --set-active Cloud
Profile created
```

Creating a profile (with the name `OSS`) for the open source version of Golem:

```bash
$ golem-cli profile add golem OSS --component-url http://localhost:9881
Profile created
```

Creating a profile (with the name `OSS`) for the open source version of Golem using open source specific `golem-cli`:

```bash
$ golem-cli profile add OSS --component-url http://localhost:9881
Profile created
```

#### Switching profile

Get profiles list:

```bash
$ golem-cli profile list
 * Cloud
   OSS
```

Change active profile:

```
$ golem-cli profile switch OSS
Active profile updated
```

## Registration

<Callout type="info">This functionality is specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

A new user can launch the binary and create a new account on Golem Cloud by signing up with their Github account via the oauth2 protocol.

### Account registration workflow

1. Users runs any Golem CLI command that requires an account, initiating authentication.

   ```bash
   golem-cli account get
    >>
    >>  Application requests to perform OAuth2
    >>  authorization.
    >>
    >>  Visit following URL in a browser:
    >>
    >>   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    >>   ┃ https://github.com/login/device ┃
    >>   ┗━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┛
    >>
    >>  And enter following code:
    >>
    >>   ┏━━━━━━━━━━━┓
    >>   ┃ 1234-ABCD ┃
    >>   ┗━━━━━━━━━━━┛
    >>
    >>  Code will expire in 14 minutes at 01:03:51.
    >>

   Waiting...
   ```

2. The Github OAuth server returns an access_token id to Golem CLI.
3. Golem CLI then registers a new golem_token using the access_token
   1. Golem service queries the external using the access_token to obtain login name, user name and primary email.
   2. If Golem Cloud doesn't have this user, a new account is created on-demand.
   3. Golem Cloud creates a new golem_token linked for the user and returns it.
   4. All tokens are cached in `$HOME/.golem` directory. It is safe to delete this directory in case of login issues, as it can be re-created through re-authentication.

## Getting help

To obtain help for using the CLI, use `--help`. Similarly, use `--help` option after a subcommand to get subcommand documentation.

## Output format

There are 3 output formats supported:

- `text` - human readable. Default.
- `json`
- `yaml`

Most of commands support output format configuration.

You can specify output format via `-F` (`--format`) option or via CLI profile configuration.
You can specify default format while creating your profile, you can also change it via the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli profile config format FORMAT
```

## Creating a new component

The compiled code Golem can execute is called a **golem component**. Before we can upload a component we need to create its guest-language specific source and compile it to a WebAssembly program.

The following CLI commands help with this:

### `golem-cli list-examples`

Golem has a library of **examples** which you can use as a starting point for your program. (The examples are defined in the open-source https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples repository).

The `list-examples` command can list and filter the available commands for you.

- Use `--language X` to filter for your chosen guest language, such as `Rust`, `Go`, etc.
- Use `--tier N` to show only examples for a given **language tier** - see [Building Components](/docs/building-components) for a definition of tiers.

### `golem-cli new`

Once you selected the example to use you can use the `new` command to create a new directory ready to be compiled to a **golem component**.

You have to specify two parameters:

- `--example NAME` with the selected example's name, for example `rust-actor-minimal`
- `--component-name NAME` with your chosen name for the new component. You can use either PascalCase, snake_case or kebab-case for the name. Try to avoid numbers if possible, as some components may have problems with it.

Optionally you can also specify a package name:

- `--package-name NAME` which should be in a `pack:name` format. If not specified the default should will be `golem:component`.

The command prints out the **instructions** specific to the generated source that describes how to compile it to a WASM file ready to be uploaded to **Golem**.

### `golem-cli component add`

Once you have the compiled WASM you have to **upload** it to the system before you can start creating workers based on it. If it is a new component, use the `component add` command (if it is a new version of an existing component you can use `component update`).

Required parameters:

- `--component-name NAME` is the name of the component in **Golem**. You can use the same name you used for instantiating the example, but it is not necessary.
- `component.wasm` the path to the compiled WASM program

<Callout type="info">Projects are specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

Optionally you can also organise your components into separate **projects**. If not specified, each new component is added to the **default project** of your account.

If needed, you can select an already created project (read below for information about how to create one) by either its name or Golem URI:

- `--project-name NAME`
- `--project urn:project:UUID`

Once the component is successfully uploaded the CLI will print its **metadata**. The metadata contains all the detected **exported functions** with their type signature. See the [Component Interface](/docs/component-interface) page for more information about types and how they are mapped to JSON structures.

## Creating and invoking workers

The uploaded component is just a definition of a runnable code but it does not run by itself. You can create an arbitrary number of **workers** based on a component, each holding to its own state and allowing you to invoke **exported functions** on them.

Workers hold some per-worker data which you can specify when you create one, and can be used to store configuration of that worker. These are **environment variables** and the list of **arguments** (which would be passed to the `main` function if it was a regular executable process).

If you try to invoke a function on a worker that does not exist yet, it will be automatically created with the default properties (empty list of environment variables and arguments).

### `golem-cli worker add`

The `worker add` command creates a new worker based on a component, but does not invoke it yet. This prepares the worker, initializes it and loads in memory.

You need to give a **unique name** to your worker (unique **per component**). If the worker corresponds to some business entity in your system, you can use the identifier of that for example.

- `--worker-name NAME`

You also have to specify which **component** to create the worker based on. This can be done by name or by the component's URI (an URN you get when you execute `component add`).

Either specify:

- `--component URI` if you know the URN of the component

Or:

- `--component-name` if you only know its name.

<Callout type="info">Projects are specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

Note that component names are only unique within a project. If you have multiple **projects** with components you also have to specify which project you mean, either by its name or its URI:

- `--project-name NAME`
- OR `--project URI`

Optionally you can also specify a list of **environment variables** and a list of **command line arguments** which are static during the worker's lifetime and accessible through standard library functions of your chosen guest language:

- `--env NAME1=VALUE1` defines an environment variable `NAME1` with a value `VALUE1`. You can have multiple `--env` parameters to define more.
- `arg1 arg2 ...` all the remaining parameters of the command are passed to the worker as command line arguments.

The newly created worker will always use the **latest version** of the component that you uploaded via `component add` or `component update`.

### `golem-cli worker invoke-and-await`

The `worker invoke-and-await` command executes an **exported function** of a **worker** and waits for its return value.

This is the primary command to execute something in **Golem** if you are also interested in its result value. Alternatively you can use `worker invoke` to just trigger the execution of a function without waiting for it. This is useful for long-running functions where you don't want to block until they finish running.

When invoking a function you have to specify the worker name or worker URI.

Either specify:

- `--worker URI` if you know the URN - you can get it as part of worker metadata.

Or:

- `--worker-name NAME` if you only know its name.

When using worker name you have to specify the component your worker is based on (as worker names are only unique within a component's scope!). This can be done in multiple ways, as described above.

Either specify:

- `--component URI` if you know the URN of the component

Or:

- `--component-name` if you only know its name.

<Callout type="info">Projects are specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

Note that component names are only unique within a project. If you have multiple **projects** with components you also have to specify which project you mean, either by its name or its URI:

- `--project-name NAME`
- OR `--project URI`

If the worker does not exist, it will be created with default parameters (empty environment variables and command line arguments).

And the function to be called with all its parameters:

- `--function NAME` the fully qualified name of the exported function

You can specify parameters either as JSON array:

- `--parameters JSON_ARR` a JSON array with all the parameters to be passed to the exported function. If the function does not expect any parameters it should be an empty array (`[]`)
  Or as separate parameters in WAVE format:
- `--arg '"str"' --arg '[1, 2, 3]'`

See the [Component Interface](/docs/component-interface) page for more information about what a fully qualified exported function name is, and how to encode the different types in JSON.

There is one more optional parameters to this command:

- `--idempotency-key KEY` associates an idempotency key. The idempotency key can be an arbitrary, client-generated string and Golem guarantees to only execute an invocation with a given idempotency key once.

## Observing workers

### `golem-cli worker get`

To get the status and some additional metadata about a worker you can use the `worker get` command.

To use this command you need to specify the component and the worker name, the same way as described above for `worker invoke-and-await`.

### `golem-cli worker list`

To get the status and some additional metadata about a component workers you can use the `worker list` command.

To use this command you need to specify the component name or id. You can filter workers metadata:

- `--filter "property op value"` - filter examples: `--filter "name = worker-name"`, `--filter "version >= 0"`, `--filter "status = Running"`, `--filter "env.var1 = value"`, `--filter "created_at > 2024-04-01T12:10:00Z"`. Can be used multiple times (AND condition is applied between them)

### `golem-cli worker connect`

Connecting to a worker allows you to have a stream of the worker's output, similar to how `kubectl log` works in a Kubernetes environment.

This is an aggregated streaming log from the following sources:

- The worker's **standard output**
- The worker's **standard error**
- The worker's **logs** via the WASI [logging interface](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-logging)

To use this command you need to specify the component and the worker name, the same way as described above for `worker invoke-and-await`.

### Deployment

The deployment facilities of Golem CLI allow developers to create, deploy, manage, and interact with user-defined components within Golem. There is optional `--project-name` parameters in all deployment commands. If no project is specified, the default project for the account is used.

### Projects

<Callout type="info">Projects are specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

The projects facilities of Golem CLI allow developers to create and manage projects, which are collections of components that are owned by an account within Golem Cloud.

When a new user account is created, an automatic default project is created for this user. When a user is working with components and workers and doesn't specify the project, the default one is assumed.

| golem-cloud-cli project list [--project-name &lt;text&gt;]                                   | Lists all projects the user has access to.    |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| golem-cloud-cli project add --project-name &lt;text&gt; [--project-description &lt;text&gt;] | Creates new project owned by current account. |
| golem-cloud-cli project get-default                                                          | Shows default project details.                |

### Sharing

<Callout type="info">Sharing is specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

The sharing facilities of Golem CLI allow developers to share either account- or project-level access with other accounts on Golem Cloud.

| golem-cloud-cli share --project-name &lt;text&gt; --recipient-account-id &lt;text&gt; --project-policy-id &lt;text&gt; | Share project access with a given account using specified project policy.          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| golem-cloud-cli share --project-name &lt;text&gt; --recipient-account-id &lt;text&gt; --project-actions &lt;text&gt;   | Share project access with a given account using specified list of allowed actions. |

### Tokens

<Callout type="info">Tokens are specific to Golem Cloud.</Callout>

The tokens facility of Golem CLI allow developers to create and manage tokens, which are API keys that can be used in programmatic scenarios for interacting with Golem Cloud Services.

| golem-cloud-cli token list                               | Lists all tokens that the user created.                                 |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| golem-cloud-cli token add [--expires-at &lt;instant&gt;] | Creates a new token with the optional expiration.Returns token details. |

### Examples

Golem-cli can create new component source code based on examples for different languages

| golem-cli list-examples [--language &lt;text&gt;]                                                | Lists existing examples.                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| golem-cli new --example &lt;text&gt; --component-name &lt;text&gt; [--package-name &lt;text&gt;] | Create example component source code project using specified example. |

### Account

#### Golem resource URI

Each Golem resource can be identifyed using Golem URI.

There are 2 kinds of URI: URN and URL. In Golem CLI URN and URL can be used whenever user has to identify the resource.
If you want to invoke worker function you can identify worker via `--worker URI` instead of worker name and component name.
If you want to update component you can identify component via `--component URI` instead of component name and project name.

##### Golem resource URL

Golem resource URL supposed to be human readable and can be constructed by user.

Some examples of Golem resource URLs:

- `component:///component-name` - component with name `component-name`
- `worker:///component-name/worker-name` - worker with name `worker-name` of component `component-name`
- `api-definition:///definition-id/version` - API definition with name and version
- `api-deployment:///subdomain.host`

##### Golem resource URN

Golem resource URN is not supposed to be human readable and user should not try to cunstruct a `URN`.
User can get resource URN as part of resource metadata. Resource creation command and resource search command should return resource URN together with resource description.

Unlike URL, resource URN requires no additional actions to resolve resource location, so it might be slightly more efficient to use URN to identify resource.

Worker URN is the same URN that should be used for worker RPC calls.

Some examples of Golem resource URNs:

- `urn:component:c201c162-fd68-4750-9e7b-9aee8993beff`
- `urn:worker:c201c162-fd68-4750-9e7b-9aee8993beff/worker_name`

##### Getting Golem resource metadata

Having Golem resource URI you can get resource metagata using the following command:

```bash
golem-cli get URI
```

This command returns resource metadata in resource type cpecific format. i.e. `golem-cli get component:///component-name` is similar to `golem-cli component get --component-name component-name`.
