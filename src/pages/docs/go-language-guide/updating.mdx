# Updating workers to newer versions of Go components

As described in the general [Workers](/docs/concepts-workers) page, each worker runs on a specific version of the component it is based on, but it is possible to **update** a worker to a different version of the same component.

## Automatic update

The **automatic update** mode has no Go-specific details and works as it is described in the general [Workers](/docs/concepts-workers) page.
