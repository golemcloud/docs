# HTTP requests in Go

Golem implements the [WASI HTTP](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http) interfaces so any library built on this specification can be used from Golem components to communicate with external services.

By using the [Golem Go SDK](/docs/go-language-guide/golem-go-sdk), Go's built-in `net/http` package can be configured to use the WASI HTTP interfaces.

To do so, simply import and set Golem's `Roundtrip` implementation:

```go
import (
	"github.com/golemcloud/golem-go/roundtrip"
	"net/http"
)

http.DefaultClient.Transport = roundtrip.WasiHttpTransport{};
```
