# Using WASI interfaces from Go

Golem implements and exports a subset of the [WASI](https://wasi.dev) interfaces, as well as its own **runtime interfaces**.

The [Golem Go SDK](/docs/go-language-guide/golem-go-sdk) provides idiomatic wrappers on a subset of these interfaces, but it is also possible to use the generated bindings directly.

## WIT specifications

The full set of WIT specifications Golem implements is available in the following public repository:

https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/tree/main/wit/deps

The following table lists all packages provided by Golem:

| Package           | Description                                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `golem:api`       | Golem's Runtime API                                                                         |
| `golem:rpc`       | Provides support for Worker to Worker communication                                         |
| `wasi:blobstore`  | Interface for storing and retrieving large binary data                                      |
| `wasi:cli`        | Interface for environment variables and standard I/O                                        |
| `wasi:clocks`     | Interface for querying the system time                                                      |
| `wasi:filesystem` | Interface for working with files and directories                                            |
| `wasi:http`       | Interface for making HTTP requests                                                          |
| `wasi:io`         | Interface for working with futures and streams                                              |
| `wasi:keyvalue`   | Interface for storing and retrieving key-value pairs - only partially implemented           |
| `wasi:logging`    | Interface for logging messages                                                              |
| `wasi:random`     | Interface for generating random numbers                                                     |
| `wasi:sockets`    | Interface for working with TCP and UDP sockets (currently not supporting durable execution) |

## Bindings

It is possible to manually add these `WIT` specifications to a Rust component using `cargo-component`, but it is recommended to use the `golem-rust` and `golem-wasm-rpc` libraries instead.

- `golem-rust` reexports all the bindings generated for the above listed interfaces
- `golem-wasm-rpc` contains the bindings and the higher level implementation of the `golem:rpc` interface

## Additional Golem runtime APIs

This section describes Golem-specific functionalities which are available through the Golem runtime API but does not have an idiomatic Rust wrapper in the `golem-go` library yet.
