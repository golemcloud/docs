# Quickstart

This guide will get you up and running in Golem in minutes.

### Install Golem CLI

Golem CLI is a command-line application that allows you to deploy new invincible workers onto Golem.

There are **precompiled binaries** of `golem-cli` (and its other variants) for various platforms. Alternatively you can build it for yourself.

<Callout type="info">
To build `golem-cli` you need to use `cargo`, Rust's build tool.

To get `cargo` on your system, we recommend to use [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable
rustup default stable
```

</Callout>

#### Recommended CLI version

You can download the universal version of `golem-cli` from the following page:

<Cards num={1}>
  <Card
    title="Golem Cloud Releases"
    href="https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-cloud-releases/releases"
  />
</Cards>

Alternatively you can build and install the universal version of `golem-cli` with the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cargo install --features universal golem-cloud-cli
```

The comman above installs both universal `golem-cli` (with support for cloud and open source version) and cloud specific `golem-cloud-cli`.

#### Alternative CLI versions

You can download the cloud specific `golem-cloud-cli` without supporting OSS deployments from the following page:

<Cards num={1}>
  <Card
    title="Golem Cloud Releases"
    href="https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-cloud-releases/releases"
  />
</Cards>

Alternatively you can build and install cloud specific `golem-cloud-cli` without universal `golem-cli` with the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cargo install golem-cloud-cli --bin golem-cloud-cli
```

You can download the open source specific `golem-cli` without supporting Golem Cloud from the following page:

<Cards num={1}>
  <Card title="Golem Releases" href="https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/releases" />
</Cards>

Alternatively you can build and install open sorcce specific `golem-cli` without cloud profiles support with the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cargo install golem-cli
```

<Callout type="info">
  Open source specific `golem-cli` and universal `golem-cli` can not be installed at the same time.
  {/* prettier-ignore */}

We will use universal `golem-cli` in all examples, but `golem-cloud-cli` supports all commands supported by universal `golem-cli`.

</Callout>

### Setting up Golem

To use the open source version of Golem you need to deploy it in your own infrastructure.

To get started we recommend using the Docker Compose file from the [Golem Docker examples](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/main/docker-examples/docker-compose-.yaml). You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

Once you have Docker Compose installed, you can make use of docker-compose file in Golem repository to spin up Golem.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Download an example docker-compose file along with .env file that has a few common configurations
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemcloud/golem/main/docker-examples/docker-compose-postgres.yaml -O  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemcloud/golem/main/docker-examples/.env

# Start Golem with backend storage as PostgreSQL and Redis
docker-compose -f docker-compose-postgres.yaml up
```

Note that, here we are making use of an example docker-compose file. You may need to modify it to suit your needs,
or refer other examples in Golem [repository](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/tree/main/docker-examples).
That said, the example docker-compose file along with .env file should be enough to get you started.

If you are running into any port conflicts you can modify the `.env` file that was downloaded as part of the above curl command.

<Callout type="info">If you are using the hosted version of Golem, you can skip this step.</Callout>

See also [deployment](deployment-overview.mdx) page for additional deployment options.

### Creating CLI profile

To specify Golem service location run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli init
```

This command starts an iteractive configuration process. For non-interactive options - see [Golem CLI](cli-introduction.mdx) page.

On the first step you'll see 3 options:

- Golem Default. Use this options for default local docker compose installation.
- Golem. Use this option in case of a customised Golem installation, i.e. a custom `GOLEM_ROUTER_PORT` in `.env` file.
- Golem Cloud. Use this option for a hosted version of Golem.

If you can't see `Golem Cloud` option - you are using an open source specific version of `golem-cli` instead of universal `golem-cli`.

### Building an Example

Golem runs components that are WebAssembly programs. Components are like applications, except they may expose functions that can be called externally.

To deploy to Golem, you must first [build a component](/docs/building-components) using any programming language and toolchain that can build WebAssembly components.

To get started quickly, you can use Golem CLI to create a component from an example:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli new --example rust-shopping-cart --component-name shopping_cart
```

This will generate a new `shopping_cart` directory in the current directory with the example for your component.

To **build** the newly created component you need some development tools installed. These are collected for each supported **guest language** on the [Building Components](/docs/building-components) page. For the above example, please read the [Rust](/docs/building-components/tier-1/rust) specific instructions to set up `cargo-component`.

Once you have that, navigate to the `shopping_cart`, and run:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
cargo component build --release
```

This will write the resulting component to `shopping_cart/target/wasm32-wasi/release/shopping_cart.wasm`.

<Callout>
  The `golem-cli new` command prints out the necessary steps to build your component exactly as you
  have to type them - using your custom component and package names and the selected example's
  language specific tools.
</Callout>

### Uploading Your Component

To upload your component to Golem, you can use the `component add` command. Navigate to `shopping_cart/target/wasm32-wasi/release` and then do:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli component add --component-name shopping-cart shopping_cart.wasm
```

Uploading a component to Golem does not actually execute the component. Instead, it only makes it available for execution to Golem
.

Every separate execution of your component is referred to as a _worker_ based on that component.

### Create Workers

In Golem, every worker has a unique id, which is arbitrary text that you define. If you don't need a meaningful id for workers, you can generate a UUID.

Once you have chosen a worker id, you can launch the worker either explicitly, or by invoking any function on the worker (for example, a “main” function).

Here, we creating a new worker `shopping-cart-1` :

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli worker add \
  --worker-name shopping-cart-1 \
  --component-name shopping-cart
```

When you add a component you will see some basic information about the component such as its name, unique identifier, version, and size. In addition, you will see a list of exports. These are the public API of your worker and can be used to call it with the CLI or REST API, as we will see below.

### Invoking Workers

Thanks to the WebAssembly component model, your Golem applications are not just an executable. Rather, they may export functions that can be called from the outside. Exported functions allow your workers to be given instructions or queried for their state.

Here, we invoke the function `initialize_cart` on the worker with a single string parameter:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli worker invoke-and-await \
    --component-name shopping-cart \
    --worker-name shopping-cart-1 \
    --function 'golem:component/api.{initialize-cart}' \
    --arg '"test-user"'
```

If a worker of the specified name has not been created, then when you attempt to invoke a function on the worker, it will first be created.

The parameters are either listed one by one with separate `--arg` options using the [WAVE format](https://github.com/lann/wasm-wave), or as a single JSON array using `--parameters`.

Check the [Component interface](concepts-components.mdx) section to learn about how to figure out the **function name** and how to encode your parameters in JSON.

### Next Steps
