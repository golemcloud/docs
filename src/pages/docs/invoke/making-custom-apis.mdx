# Making custom APIs

The [Worker Gateway](/docs/concepts/worker-gateway) service not only exposes the [low-level REST API for invocations](/docs/invoke/http) but also provides a way to define fully customizable HTTP APIs. Future versions will support other protocols as well such as gRPC or GraphQL.

## Example

Take the _shopping cart example_ (available via `golem-cli new --example rust-example-shopping-cart`):

```
$ golem-cli component get --component-name cart

Component with URN urn:component:c57de1ee-fbe5-4068-a67d-908addc8aa44. Version: 0. Component size is 2900607 bytes.
Component name: cart.
Exports:
	golem:component/api.{initialize-cart}(user-id: string)
	golem:component/api.{add-item}(item: record { product-id: string, name: string, price: float32, quantity: u32 })
	golem:component/api.{remove-item}(product-id: string)
	golem:component/api.{update-item-quantity}(product-id: string, quantity: u32)
	golem:component/api.{checkout}() -> variant { error(string), success(record { order-id: string }) }
	golem:component/api.{get-cart-contents}() -> list<record { product-id: string, name: string, price: float32, quantity: u32 }>
```

Here is an example of an API definition, which we will use to expose an HTTP API over the function `golem:component/api.{get-cart-contents}`.

```yaml
id: my-shopping-cart-v1
draft: true
version: 0.0.4
routes:
  - method: Get
    path: /v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents
    binding:
      type: wit-worker
      componentId:
        componentId: dba38841-013a-49fa-a1dc-064949832f0c
        version: 0
      workerName: |
        let user: u64 = request.path.user-id;
        my-worker-${user}
      response: |
        let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();
        {status: 200u64, body: result}
```

Please use this as a reference instead of using it with zero changes. For example, you might need to give a different
version, componentId etc (explained below). You can get the `component` details including `componentId`
by running `golem-cli component list` command.

The API definition's fields have the following meaning:

| Field     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `id`      | This field represents the unique identifier for the API definition. In this case, it is set to "shopping-cart-v1".                                                                                                                                                    |
| `version` | This field indicates the version of the API definition. Here, it is set to "0.0.3".                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `routes`  | This field contains an array of route objects, each representing a specific endpoint definition.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `method`  | Indicates the HTTP method associated with the route. In this example, it is set to "Get", indicating that this route handles GET requests.                                                                                                                            |
| `path`    | Specifies the URL path pattern for the route. It may include path parameters enclosed in curly braces. Here, the path is `/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`, indicating that this route handles requests to retrieve the contents of a shopping cart for a specific user. |
| `binding` | This object contains information about how the request should be handled by the Golem worker.                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Golem Worker Binding

Let's break down the binding object.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `type`        | Specifies the type of binding. Here, it is set to "wit-worker", indicating that the binding involves a Golem worker. Currently, the only supported type is "wit-worker".                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `componentId` | Provides the component ID associated with the worker binding. As you can see the the golem-worker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `workerName`  | Specifies the Name of the Golem worker responsible for handling the request. Here it is `my-worker-${request.path.user-id}`. The value that is wrapped in code block (starting with `${` and ending with `}`) will be a Rib expression. Here `request.path.user-id` is a valid Rib expression where it selects the field `path` from the `request` block, and further selects `user-id` from it. |
| `response`    | The `response` field here is a Rib expression (therefore wrapped in a code block) that allows you to call any worker function and manipulates its output.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Note that workerName and response are actually rib expressions. It gives you the flexibility to make necessary changes to the input and output to a worker function,
as well as dynamically create a worker name.

If your worker name is a constant, the you can simply make it a constant string such as `"foo"`. Please note that it has to be quoted for it a valid Rib string.
See the [Rib reference](/docs/rib) for the full reference of the binding language.

In this example, the following Rib expression defines the request:

```
let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();
{status: 200u64, body: result}

```

The first line is about calling the worker-function and assigning its result to the variable `result`. The last line is a WASM record where you are mapping to the response. Here body is `result` itself.
That means, we are not manipulating the result returned by the function, and simply forward it as response body. Status is 200u64. `u64` is the type of the number
as Rib is typed and it needs to know the full type of the WASM record. `200u64` is equivalent to `let x: u64 = 200; x;` in Rib.

As mentioned above, see the [Rib reference](/docs/rib) to know more about Rib language.

There are various possibilities here to manipulate the data using Rib
language, such as selecting only a particular field from the result of the function invocation. Say for example, the result is a WASM `result` which can be `ok` or `err`. In this case you
can have a complex Rib expression as below

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();

let response_status = match result {
  ok(_) => 200u32,
  err(_) => 400u32
};

let response_body = match result {
  ok(result) => result,
  err(msg) => msg
}

{status: response_status, body: response_body}

```

The result of the Rib expression is whatever the result of the last line/expression in the above Rib program, similar to many programming languages.
Note, the last line of Rib is not ending with a `;`.

## Upload API definition

The API definitions can be uploaded to Golem using one of the following methods:

- Use the [Golem CLI](/docs/cli) tool
- Use the [Rest APIs](/docs/rest-api)
- Use [Golem Console](https://console.golem.cloud/) (Only available in Golem Cloud)

The following example uses `golem-cli` to add a new API definition to the system.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli api-definition add api-definition.json

```

This returns:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{
  "id": "my-shopping-cart-v1",
  "version": "0.0.4",
  "routes": [
    {
      "method": "Get",
      "path": "/v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents",
      "binding": {
        "componentId": {
          "componentId": "dba38841-013a-49fa-a1dc-064949832f0c",
          "version": 0
        },
        "workerName": "let user: u64 = request.path.user-id;\n\"my-worker-${user}\"",
        "idempotencyKey": null,
        "response": "let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();\n{status: 200u64, body: result}",
        "responseMappingInput": {
          "types": {}
        },
        "workerNameInput": {
          "types": {
            "request": {
              "type": "Record",
              "fields": [
                {
                  "name": "path",
                  "typ": {
                    "type": "Record",
                    "fields": [
                      {
                        "name": "user-id",
                        "typ": {
                          "type": "U64"
                        }
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "idempotencyKeyInput": null
      }
    }
  ],
  "draft": true,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-31T07:40:16.239763054Z"
}
```

This API definition is still a **draft** since it is still not `deployed` yet.
Once it is deployed you cannot further update this definition unless you change the version, to avoid breaking your public API.

The API definition can also be uploaded directly using REST APIs.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -X POST http://localhost:9881/v1/api/definitions -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @api-definition.json
```

Here `localhost:9881` is where worker-service (that implements the Worker Gateway) is running, ready to accept these API management requests.
The docker-compose example (explained in quick-start) currently exposes the port 9881 for worker-service.

## Deploy the API Definition

Using golem-cli, deploying the API definition is straight forward.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli api-deployment deploy --definition my-shopping-cart-v1/0.0.4 --host localhost:9006

```

The above command returns the following:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

{
  "apiDefinitions": [
    {
      "id": "my-shopping-cart-v1",
      "version": "0.0.4"
    }
  ],
  "site": {
    "host": "localhost:9006",
    "subdomain": null
  },
  "createdAt": "2024-10-31T07:36:47.497267721Z"
}

```

Here we deploy the definition and now the endpoints should be available at `host` `localhost:9006`. If you were following docker examples to spin up Golem, then the port has to be 9006.
Refer to `.env` in docker-examples folder in Golem OSS.

You can test the deployment now, by trying to call the endpoint defined in the API definition.

## Watch out for errors during deployment

Please note the following: If you already deployed an API definition before with the same path `/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`,
then you will receive a conflict error as given below, instead of the response above.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
API deployment definitions conflict error: /{user-id}/get-cart-contents
```

This implies, when you update the version, you have to update the path as well, such as `/v5/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`
under the `path` field in `route`.

## Use the deployed API

Given, you have successfully deployed, now you can try to invoke the following:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:9006/v4/100/get-cart-contents
[]
```

Here the worker-gateway identifies the user to be `100`
and evaluates the worker-name expr to be `my-worker-100`
by evaluating `workerName` Rib expression.

Once it identifies the worker-name, it goes on evaluating the `response` Rib expression which internally invokes the worker function function `golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}`
with empty parameters, and simply get the worker-response (which is a WASM value)
and converts it to `Json` and sends it back to the client.

## Watch out for errors when using API

Given the Rib script is strongly typed, tere are chances of failures if you break the types.
Here is an example:

Based on the workerName script that is deployed above (specified below for quick reference), the `user-id` in the path
should be `u64`

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let user: u64 = request.path.user-id; \"my-worker-${user}\""
```

This implies Rib expects the input `user-id` to be `u64`. Otherwise, it will fail with type-error.
If you are using golem-OSS, you can see the following in docker logs

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
Failed to resolve the API definition; error: Worker binding resolution error: Failed to resolve rib input value from http request details Rib input type mismatch:
Input request details don't match the requirements for rib expression to execute:
Invalid value for the key path.
Error: Invalid value for the key user-id. Error: Expected function parameter type is u64.
But found String.
Requirements. Record(TypeRecord { fields: [NameTypePair { name: "path", typ: Record(TypeRecord { fields: [NameTypePair { name: "user-id", typ: U64(TypeU64) }] }) }] })
```

This implies the `request` input should have a field called `path` in it, which in turn has a field called `user-id`,
and its type _should be_ u64.

This could have been a `BadRequest` error. But sometimes, the route may not be resolved due to wrong types.
and this time client may not get back the reason for error. We will try to improve this as we go.
In any case, during development phase, you will need to investigate errors like this by inspecting the logs
in worker-service docker container.

## Authentication in API Gateway

Golem API gateway has inbuilt authentication support to identify users using OpenID protocol.
This allows you to refer to the claims such as `request.auth.email` (as an example) once authenticated in your Rib expression.
You can choose to get pass this information into the worker function that exist in the Rib expression, and do further logic with it.
Currently, this is tested with Google Identity connector.

You can register your app with Google Identity Provider and get a client-id and client-secret for your app that is to be exposed through golem API gateway.

### Setup Security for your API routes in Golem

1. Register your app with Google Identity Provider and get a client-id and client-secret.

Here is the direct link to register your app with [Google Identity Provider](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
Here you can register your app with a name, and most importantly a redirect URL.
A typical example of a redirect url is `https://mydomain.com/auth/callback`, where `mydomain.com` is the domain in which you will be deploying your API definition in Golem.
For testing with OSS version, most probably this can be a localhost, and you can register your test application with `http://localhost:9006/auth/callback`.
The `/auth/callback` part is just an example and it can be anything, as far as it doesn't collide with any of your other paths.

Once you have setup the app-name, redirect-urls, you should be getting a client-id, client-secret from Google Identity Provider in return.
We call these details "Api Security Scheme" in Golem API Gateway.

2. Register your API Security Scheme with your app's client-id and client-secret with Golem

Make sure you name your security scheme uniquely, and provide the client-id, client-secret and redirect-url as given below.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli api-security-scheme create --scheme.id my-unique-security-scheme --provider.type google --client.id 1087126-.apps.googleusercontent.com --client.secret GOCSPXREDACTED- --redirect.url http://localhost:9006/auth/callback

```

3. Make sure to specify your API definition that consist of the routes of your app with the security scheme id.

This is more or less inspired from open OpenAPI spec, however Golem is doing some heavy lifting here such that you only need to specify
the security scheme id and nothing else. If you are using OpenAPI spec, you can choose to provide additional details such OpenID connect URL
but it will simply be discared by Golem but it can be useful for your own documentation purposes.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
id: my-todo-api
version: 0.0.1
draft: true
security:
- my-unique-security-scheme
routes:
- method: Get
  path: /foo/{user-id}
  security: my-unique-security-scheme
  binding:
    type: wit-worker
    componentId:
      componentId: 0b6d9cd8-f373-4e29-8a5a-548e61b868a5
      version: 0
    workerName: "\"shopping-cart\""
    response: "let email: string = request.auth.email; email"
```

The list of security schemes at the root level is optional in the API definition. You can choose to have it or not.

However, to enable security for a route, you need to specify security scheme under each route (similar to a typical OpenAPI spec).
In the above example, the security scheme is `my-unique-security-scheme`. This is the same id that you have registered with Golem API Gateway in the previous step.

The response mapping Rib script is expecting an email field in request authentication, which will be available in the context if the user is authenticated.
More on this below. Before that, let's register and deploy the above API definition stored in api_definition.yaml file.

4. Register the API definition

As explained in previous sections, register the API definition using cloud console or golem-cli.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli api-definition add api_definition.yaml  --def-format yaml

```

4. Deploy the API definition

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli api-deployment deploy --host localhost:9006 --definition my-todo-api/0.0.1
```

With this setup, your route is accessible only by authenticated users who have logged in with Google Identity Provider.

### Testing the authenticated endpoint in Golem

In your browser, you can try to access the endpoint with the following URL:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
http://localhost:9006/foo/1
```

This should redirect you to Google Identity Provider login page, and once you login,
you should be redirected back to the original URL which is http://localhost:9006/foo/1 which will now have the claims of the user in the request context,
which you can lookup using Rib script using `request.auth.name` or `request.auth.email` etc. The claims available depends on the identity provider you are using.

If you are using Google Identity Provider, you can expect `email`, `name` etc should be available in the request context.
We will be exposing claims available in a later release of Golem to make things easier for you.

#### Redirects and Cookies

Internally, there are a couple of redirects that's going on when you access the protected endpoint.
The first redirect is to the Google Identity Provider login page as explained below, and internally this is followed by identity provider hitting the redirect URL (
which is exposed on your behalf by Golem API gateway) with all the details of the user.
This is followed by another redirect to the original URL that you tried to access, and this time the session-id, tokens/secrets set in a secure Cookie, which your
browser will resend. Once the browser sends the cookie, Golem API gateway will validate the cookie and allow you to access the protected endpoint.

We will be adding more support for various clients and usecases in future releases based on the user feedback.

#### Unexposed CallBack Endpoint

Note that the callback endpoint is exposed automatically based on the re-direct url specified in the API security scheme. Users cannot customise or add
these call back endpoints manually. This is to avoid any security issues that may arise due to misconfiguration of the callback endpoint.

## Setting up CORS in API Gateway

Setting up CORS in API gateway is simple. Simplify specify the preflight request endpoint for your resource and all the operations
under the resource is now CORS enabled. This is mostly inspired from AWS API Gateway approach.

Here is an example of how to setup CORS for your API definition.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    id: users-api
    version: 0.0.1
    createdAt: 2024-08-21T07:42:15.696Z
    routes:
    - method: Options
      path: /users/{user-id}
      binding:
      bindingType: cors-preflight
    - method: Get
      path: /users/{user-id}
      binding:
      response: |
        {status: 200u64, body: "Hello World"}
```

Here we define the preflight request endpoint for `/users/{user-id}` as `Options` method.
This is used by browsers to check if the actual request is allowed.
Registering this API definition will ensure that the other operations (in the above example, Get)
will also be CORS enabled with required headers in the response.

We can define a custom response for the preflight request as well using Rib as given below

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
    id: users-api
    version: 0.0.1
    createdAt: 2024-08-21T07:42:15.696Z
    routes:
    - method: Options
      path: /users/{user-id}
      binding:
      bindingType: cors-preflight
      response: |
        {
          Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "*",
          Access-Control-Allow-Methods: "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS",
          Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "Content-Type, Authorization",
          Access-Control-Expose-Headers: "Content-Length, X-Requested-With",
          Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true,
          Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400u64
        }
    - method: Get
      path: /users/{user-id}
      binding:
      response: |
        {status: 200u64, body: "Hello World"}
```

## REST API to deploy API

As of now, we have deployed the API using golem-cli.
We can do the same using REST APIs as an alternative.

For this, let's create a `deployment.json` as given below.
Based on the example above, the apiDefinitionId is `shopping-cart-v1` and version is `0.0.4`.

If you were having a domain registered such as `my-site.com`, you would replace `localhost:9006` with `my-site.com`,
that in turn redirects to `localhost:9006`, or wherever the worker-service is running (perhaps AWS).

```json
{
  "apiDefinitions": [
    {
      "id": "my-shopping-cart-v1",
      "version": "0.0.6"
    }
  ],
  "site": {
    "host": "locahost:9006"
  }
}
```

`subdomain` field under `site` is optional. But you can provide this if its backed by a valid `host`.
For `localhost` subdomain doesn't make much sense.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

curl -X POST http://localhost:9881/v1/api/deployments/deploy -H "Content-Type: application/json"  -d @api-deployment.json

{"apiDefinitions":[{"id":"my-shopping-cart-v1","version":"0.0.4"}],"createdAt":"2024-10-31T07:59:00.390103588+00:00","site":{"host":"locahost:9006","subdomain":null}}⏎
```

## More details on Response Mapping

Response Mapping is under the `response` field under each binding. This is written using [Rib](/docs/rib) to call the worker function and manipulate it's results and return a value that's understandable for each protocol we use.

Here is a more complex example of an API definition that gives you more idea on
what can be achieved with Rib expression under response field.

Please use this as a reference instead of using it with zero changes.

```json
{
  "id": "my-shopping-cart-v2",
  "draft": true,
  "version": "2.0.11",
  "routes": [
    {
      "method": "Get",
      "path": "/{user-id}/get-cart-contents",
      "binding": {
        ..
        "workerName": "\"my-worker\"",
        "response": "let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}(); {status: 200u64, body: result}"
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "Post",
      "path": "/{user-id}/initialize-cart",
      "binding": {
        ..
        "workerName": "\"my-worker\"",
        "response": "let empty: list<u16> = []; ${golem:it/api.{initialize-cart}(request.path.user-id); {status: 200u64, body: empty}}"
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "Post",
      "path": "/{user-id}/add-item",
      "binding": {
        ..
        "workerName": "\"my-worker\"",
        "response": "let quantity: f64 = request.body.quantity; let product_id: u64 = request.body.product-id; let name: str = request.body.name; let price: f64 = request.body.price; let input = {product-id: product_id, name: name, price: price, quantity: quantity}; golem:it/api.{add-item}(input); {status: 200u64, body: \"success\"}"
      }
    },
    {
      "method": "Post",
      "path": "/{user-id}/checkout",
      "binding": {
        ..
        "workerName": "\"my-worker\"",
        "response": "let result = golem:it/api.{checkout}(); {status: 200u64, body: match result { success(resp) => resp.order-id, error(msg) => msg }}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

This example exposes multiple functions of the shopping-cart component through a custom HTTP API.
Some of these examples include longer Rib scripts under `response` field. Also since you are not using `golem console` (from golem cloud),
and relying on directly encoding `Rib` in a Http request, everything had to be in 1 single line, since multi-line doesn't work in JSON
body in http request. Improvements in this space are in progress.

Note that each line in Rib code block is separated by `;` and the last line in the Rib script is the return value which shouldn't have `;`.

Most of the above examples are self explanatory, but worth pointing out a few details.

Some of the `response` fields above have Rib script where we pass parameters to the function.
This is more or less same as many programming languages - a comma separated list of arguments.
Arguments are valid Rib code.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

golem:it/api.{initialize-cart}(request.path.user-id)

```

Here Rib compiler knows the requirement of initialize-cart function and infers that request.path.user-id should be u64.
This is a hint, that Rib is aware of the types in the code. In places where it find hard to infer these types, you may face
some compile time errors (when uploading API definition), and the best solution is to be explicit about types. For example

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let user_id: u64 = request.path.user-id;
golem:it/api.{initialize-cart}(user_id)

```

The most interesting example out of all the endpoints is the `checkout` endpoint.

Here the response mapping in Rib is this:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let result = golem:it/api.{checkout}();

{status: 200u64, body: match result { success(resp) => resp.order-id, error(msg) => msg }}

```

This can also be written as the following for more readability (with [golem console](https://console.golem.cloud):

```
let result = golem:it/api.{checkout}();
let status: u64 = 200;
let body =  match result { success(resp) => resp.order-id, error(msg) => msg };
{status: status, body: body}

```

Here we manipulate the result from worker function using a match expression. More details on match expression is explained under [Rib](/docs/rib) documentation.
It matches on `success` and `error` variants because the result type of `golem:it/api.{checkout}` is a variant which can be either success or error.

## Looking up data from the request body and path

In the above example, we have an endpoint to add products into the cart.

```json
{
  "method": "Post",
  "path": "/{user-id}/add-item",
  "binding": {
    ....
    "response": "${let product_id: u64 = request.body.product-id; golem:it/api.{add-item}({product-id: product_id}); let empty_body: list<u16> = []; {status: 200u64, body: empty_body}}"
  }
}
```

This implies, the http request should be method `POST` with request body having the following fields: `product-id`, `name`, `price` and `quantity`.

## Input `request`

Worker gateway allows you to look up the values of request path or query variables using `request.path.*` syntax.
For request body, you can use `request.body.*` syntax. Similarly for headers it is `request.headers.*`

## Inferring required inputs for API Endpoint based on Rib script

Now that, we registered API definitions, and deployed them. As you have seeen Rib script in the response field or worker name
may try to look up values from the request context. This is auto documented and you can see them in the response when you register an API definition
Golem Console provides a more user-friendly way to see these inputs.

Here is a sample response when you register an API definition, where it holds the required data in the input http request.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
{
  "id": "my-shopping-cart-v1",
  "version": "0.0.4",
  "routes": [
    {
      "method": "Get",
      "path": "/v4/{user-id}/get-cart-contents",
      "binding": {
        "componentId": {
          "componentId": "dba38841-013a-49fa-a1dc-064949832f0c",
          "version": 0
        },
        "workerName": "let user: u64 = request.path.user-id;\n\"my-worker-${user}\"",
        "idempotencyKey": null,
        "response": "let result = golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}();\n{status: 200u64, body: result}",
        "responseMappingInput": {
          "types": {
            "request": {
              "type": "Record",
              "fields": [
                {
                  "name": "path",
                  "typ": {
                    "type": "Record",
                    "fields": [
                      {
                        "name": "user-id",
                        "typ": {
                          "type": "U64"
                        }
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "workerNameInput": {
          "types": {
            "request": {
              "type": "Record",
              "fields": [
                {
                  "name": "path",
                  "typ": {
                    "type": "Record",
                    "fields": [
                      {
                        "name": "user-id",
                        "typ": {
                          "type": "U64"
                        }
                      }
                    ]
                  }
                }
              ]
            }
          }
        },
        "idempotencyKeyInput": null
      }
    }
  ],
  "draft": true,
  "createdAt": "2024-10-31T07:40:16.239763054Z"
}
```

In the above response, you can see the `responseMappingInput` field which holds the required input for the Rib script in the response field,
as well as `workerNameInput` which holds the required input for the Rib script in the workerName field.

## Constraints on Components after deployment

Please note that, once you have deployed an API using a specific component-version, then
you may not be able to update the component-version (ex: `golem-cli component update`) unless
the arguments to the functions used in the Rib script in the deployed API definition is backward compatible.

If there are conflicts (i.e, backward incompatible) then you will get a conflict report message,
which details especially the missing functions and conflicting functions, where conflicting functions
detail about existing parameter types, new parameter types, existing return type, and new return type.

## Support to import OpenAPI spec

Until now, we used the native API definition format of Golem.
Golem allows you to import API definition in OpenAPI spec format too.
This is because, users may have already written an OpenAPI spec for their endpoints for various purposes.
By adding extra details of into the same spec, we can use it as an API definition. Internally it gets converted to the Worker Gateway's native format of API definition, discussed in the beginning of this documentation.

The main advantage of this feature is the re-usability of the same endpoint definitions across your system. For example, you can use the same file now to register with Golem's Worker Gateway and register with another external API gateway. More on this below. However once deployed, it returns native format then onwards, and updates needs to be done in the native format.

```json
openapi: 3.0.0
info:

        response: |
            let x = golem:it/api.{checkout}();
            let status: u64 = 200; {headers : {ContentType: "json", userid: "foo"}, body: "foo", status: status}
      summary: Get Cart Contents
      description: Get the contents of a user's cart
      parameters:
        - name: user-id

```

To import OpenAPI spec using Golem CLI,

```bash filename="Terminal" copy

golem-cli api-definition import open_api.json

```

This will return

## Integrating worker-gateway with existing API Gateways

Note that, while the Golem's Worker Gateway is a powerful tool for defining and managing API endpoints, it is not a full-fledged API Gateway.
However, it can be used conjunction with existing API Gateways, allowing you to leverage the capabilities of both systems.
For example, you can use Golem's Worker Gateway to define and manage the worker bindings for your API endpoints, while using an API Gateway to handle other aspects of API management, such as authentication, rate limiting, and monitoring.
In this scenario, the third party API Gateway would route incoming requests to Golem based on the defined endpoints, allowing Golem's Worker Gateway to handle the request processing and response generation.

### Tyk

This section shows how to integrate with [Tyk API gateway](https://tyk.io).

Note that Tyk allows users to upload OpenAPI spec similar to Golem. You can upload the same OpenAPI spec with worker-gateway info to Tyk,
with 1 more extra information which is `servers` block with the value of the URL of the Golem Worker Gateway (which is the URL of the worker-service service in docker),
that tells the Tyk API gateway of Tyk to route the request to worker-gateway.

Please note, the above set up will work depending on how you installed Tyk.
If you installed Tyk in the same network as worker-gateway, you can use the localhost as servers.

If you are using a separate docker network with Tyk, you will need to give the machine IP address to reach the Worker Gateway URL.

```json
openapi: 3.0.0
x-golem-api-definition-version: 0.0.3
x-golem-api-definition-id: shopping-cart-v1

            type: string

        name:
          type: string
        price:
          type: number

```

The difference here is we added the server's block. You can include this servers block from the beginning
so that it's exactly the same OpenAPI spec which you used to upload to Golem as well as Tyk.

#### Install Tyk

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-gateway-docker
cd tyk-gateway-docker
docker-compose up
```

#### Registration with Tyk

Let's say we saved the above json as open_api.json

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/tyk/apis/oas/import --header 'x-tyk-authorization: foo' --header 'Content-Type: text/plain' -d @open_api.json

```

Reload the Tyk API Gateway, otherwise the API is not deployed with Tyk yet, so this is an important step.
Note that, if you are encountering issues following these steps, please refer to Tyk documentations.

```bash
curl -H "x-tyk-authorization: foo" -s http://localhost:8080/tyk/reload/group

```

Note that Tyk is now running at 8080, and now requests has to go into 8080 and not the Golem Worker Gateway.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -X GET http://localhost:9006/adam/get-cart-contents
```

## FAQ

**How does worker service know which API definition to pick for a given endpoint?**

When a request comes in, worker-service looks at the host in the request and matches it with the site in the deployment.
If there is a deployment corresponding to the site, it picks the API definition ID and version from the deployment and gets the API definition,
to further process the request
