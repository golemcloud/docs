## Watch out for errors during deployment

Please note the following: If you already deployed an API definition before with the same path `/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`,
then you will receive a conflict error as given below, instead of the response above.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
API deployment definitions conflict error: /{user-id}/get-cart-contents
```

This implies, when you update the version, you have to update the path as well, such as `/v5/{user-id}/get-cart-contents`
under the `path` field in `route`.

## Watch out for errors when using the deployed API

If your API's implementation (Rib script which internally calls workers) gets a wrong input,
it produces a `BadRequest`. This makes Golem Gateway much more type safe than a typical Gateway
where it always routes to the backend regardless of wrong inputs.

Here is an example:

Based on the below Rib script which is part of `workerName` in API definition, the `user-id` in the path
should be of the type `u64`.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
let user: u64 = request.path.user-id; \"my-worker-${user}\""
```

This implies Rib expects the input `user-id` to be `u64`. Otherwise, it will fail with type-error.
If you are using golem-OSS, you can see the following in docker logs

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
Failed to resolve the API definition; error: Worker binding resolution error: Failed to resolve rib input value from http request details Rib input type mismatch:
Input request details don't match the requirements for rib expression to execute:
Invalid value for the key path.
Error: Invalid value for the key user-id. Error: Expected function parameter type is u64.
But found String.
Requirements. Record(TypeRecord { fields: [NameTypePair { name: "path", typ: Record(TypeRecord { fields: [NameTypePair { name: "user-id", typ: U64(TypeU64) }] }) }] })
```

This implies the `request` input should have a field called `path` in it, which in turn has a field called `user-id`,
and its type _should be_ u64.

This could have been a `BadRequest` error. But sometimes, the route may not be resolved due to wrong types.
and this time client may not get back the reason for error. We will try to improve this as we go.
In any case, during development phase, you will need to investigate errors like this by inspecting the logs
in worker-service docker container.
