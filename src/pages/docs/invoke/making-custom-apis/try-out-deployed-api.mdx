## Use the deployed API

Given, you have successfully deployed, now you can try to invoke the following:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl -H "Accept: application/json" -X GET http://localhost:9006/v4/100/get-cart-contents
[]
```

Here the worker-gateway identifies the user to be `100`
and evaluates the worker-name expr to be `my-worker-100`
by evaluating `workerName` Rib expression.

Once it identifies the worker-name, it goes on evaluating the `response` Rib expression which internally invokes the worker function function `golem:it/api.{get-cart-contents}`
with empty parameters, and simply get the worker-response (which is a WASM value)
and converts it to a proper Http Response.
