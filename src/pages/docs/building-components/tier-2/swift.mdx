# Swift

First you have to install the Swift-WASM package from [https://book.swiftwasm.org/setup.html](https://book.swiftwasm.org/setup.html).

You also have to install everything as described in [Common tooling](/docs/building-components/common-tooling).

As Swift is currently a Tier 2 guest language, you can only call your whole Swift program from Golem exposed as a parameterless `run` function.

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart).

If you prefer to do it from scratch, take the following simple Swift program saved into `main.swift`:

```swift
import Foundation

let date = Date()
let calendar = Calendar.current

let year = calendar.component(.year, from: date)

print("Hello world!")
print(year)
```

And compile it to WASM using **Swift-WASM:**

```bash
/Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-latest.xctoolchain/usr/bin/swiftc -target wasm32-unknown-wasi main.swift -o main.wasm -sdk /Library/Developer/Toolchains/swift-wasm-5.7.3-RELEASE.xctoolchain/usr/share/wasi-sysroot/
```

The resulting `main.wasm` is a WASM **module** not a component, so we have to use the **tier 2** WASI adapter and `wasm-tools` to convert it to a WASM **component**

```bash
wasm-tools component new main.wasm -o component.wasm --adapt tier2/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
```

The `wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm` describes the mapping from WASI Preview1 to Preview2. You **must** use the version of this file packaged together with `golem-cli.`

<Callout>Make sure you use the **tier2 adapter** from the golem package!</Callout>

The resulting `component.wasm` is ready to be used with Golem.
