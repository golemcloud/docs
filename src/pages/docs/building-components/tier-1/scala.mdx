# Scala

Scala 2 can be used to build WASM components through Scala.js and [componentize.js](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-js)

<Callout>
  `componentize.js` currently does not implement the JS Event Loop. So, if the code generated by
  Scala.js uses functions like `setTimeout` the componentization won't work
</Callout>

<Callout>Scala 3 is currently not supported</Callout>

Before starting, make sure you have the latest Rust version installed and have `cargo` in the path. The recommended way to do so is using [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
```

Then install the `golem-scalajs-wit-bindgen` CLI tool, which allows to generate Scala.js bindings from WIT files:

```bash
cargo install golem-scalajs-wit-bindgen
```

You will also need to have `npm` installed, you can check instructions [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

The easiest way to get started once the tooling is installed is to use the `golem-cli new` command as described in the [Quickstart](/docs/quickstart), for example:

```bash
golem-cli new --example scala2-shopping-cart --component-name my-shopping-cart
```

### Building the component

Creating the Golem component is just running:

```bash
sbt component
```

The output is `target/dist/component-name.wasm` and it is ready to be uploaded to **Golem Cloud.** (the output file's name depends on the project!)
