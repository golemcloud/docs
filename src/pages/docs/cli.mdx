# Golem CLI Introduction

Golem CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with Golem. Golem CLI allows users to upload their components, launch new workers based on these components and call functions on running workers.

## Golem CLI versions

There are 3 different Golem CLI versions available for installation:

- **Universal** golem-cli that supports both open sourse and hosted versions of Golem.
- **Open source** specific golem-cli without support for the hosted version of Golem.
- **Cloud** version without support for the open source version of Golem.

The universla Golem CLI includes all the functionality of the open source specific Golem CLI and Golem Cloud CLI. For these examples we will use universal `golem-cli` unless specified otherwise.

## Installation

There are two ways to install any of the above described versions of Golem CLI:

- Downloading a precompiled platform-specific binary
- Installing from source using Rust tooling

<Callout type="info">
  Open source specific `golem-cli` and universal `golem-cli` can not be installed at the same time.

</Callout>

### Downloading precompiled binaries

You can download the precompiled version of `golem-cli` from one of the following pages:

<Cards num={2}>
  <Card
    title="Universal and Golem Cloud Releases"
    href="https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-cloud-releases/releases"
  />
  <Card title="Open Source Golem Releases" href="https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/releases" />
</Cards>

We provide precompiled binaries for the following platforms:

- Mac arm64
- Mac x86_6
- Linux arm64
- Linux x86_64
- Windows x86_64

<Callout type="info">
  Some platforms may protect by default from running these downloaded binaries. You may need to
  allow running them in your system settings.
</Callout>

### Installing from source

To build `golem-cli` you need to use `cargo`, Rust's build tool.

To get `cargo` on your system, we recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable
rustup default stable
```

Then use **one** of the following commands to install the desired version of Golem CLI:

```bash filename="Universal Golem CLI" copy
cargo install --features universal golem-cloud-cli
```

```bash filename="Open source Golem CLI" copy
cargo install golem-cli
```

```bash filename="Cloud-only Golem CLI" copy
cargo install golem-cloud-cli --bin golem-cloud-cli
```

## Profiles

The Golem CLI can have multiple profiles configured, each selecting a specific Golem cluster to connect to, as well as some settings like the default output format.

See the [Golem CLI profiles page](/docs/cli/profiles) for more information.

## Working with components

Golem CLI can manage [Golem Components](/docs/concepts/components). See the [Golem CLI components page](/docs/cli/components) for details.

## Interacting with workers

Golem CLI allows creating, invoking and observing [Golem Workers](/docs/concepts/workers). See the [Golem CLI workers page](/docs/cli/workers) for more information.
