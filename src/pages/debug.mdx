# Debug workers

There are many scenarios where looking into a worker's state can be useful. It is possible that a worker ran into a **failed state**, for example. Although transient errors are automatically retried, it is possible that a worker gets permantently failed due to a programming error. It is also possible that the worker is running, but not behaving as expected.

There are several tools available in Golem to help in these situations.

### Querying the worker state

By querying the worker state you can get some basic information about whether the worker is running, is suspended or failed, how many pending invocations it has, and what was the error message if it failed.

To query the worker state using the `golem` command line tool, you can use the following command:

```shell copy
golem worker get <worker_id>
```

### Getting the worker's logs

A worker can log messages in various ways:

- Writing to the standard output (stdout)
- Writing to the standard error (stderr)
- Using the `log` function provided by WASI logging interface

All of these log sources are preserved and can be examined in live by **connecting** to the worker:

```shell copy
golem worker connect <worker_id>
```

There are also parameters for *invocation* that capture logs of the worker while an invocation is running. For more information see the [CLI worker reference](/cli/workers).

### Getting a worker's oplog

The oplog of a worker is a journal of all the operations and events happened during the worker's lifetime. It is possible to retrieve a worker's oplog, as well as to filter it with search expressions.

To get the whole oplog of a worker, you can use the following command:

```shell copy
golem worker oplog <worker_id>
```

See the [CLI worker reference](/cli/workers) for more information about how to search the oplog. One debugging scenario can be to look for all oplog entries belonging to a given **idempotency key** that was provided with an invocation that did not behave as expected. Another can be looking for occurrences of external HTTP requests or log entries.

### Applying changes to a worker

If the available information is not enough, it often helps to add more log lines to the worker. Recompiling the worker, updating the component and then updating the faulty worker will always succeed, if the only change was adding or removing log lines.

### Reverting changes to a worker

The final tool available is **reverting** the worker. This can be done in two different ways:

1. **Undoing a given number of invocations**. In this case we specify a number (N), and the last N invocations will be treated as if they never happened. The worker's state will be restored to the point before these last N invocations.
2. **Reverting to a specific oplog index**. A more advanced use case is to revert the worker to a specific point in the oplog. This can be used to force rerunning some side effects such as external HTTP requests or database operations.

To revert a worker using the `golem` command line interface, you can use the following command:

```shell copy
golem worker revert <worker_id> --number-of-invocations 3
```

or

```shell copy
golem worker revert <worker_id> --last-oplog-index 12345
```
