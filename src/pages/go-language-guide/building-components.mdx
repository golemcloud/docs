# Building Golem Components in Go
Building Golem components having an [application manifest](/app-manifest) is straightforward, just use the `golem` command line interface:

```shell copy
golem app build
```

If the project was created using `golem app new` as recommended, the `golem app build` command will always work as expected.

The result of the `golem app build` command is a WebAssembly component file ready to be uploaded to Golem. It does not have to be specified explicitly, as the `golem` tool will automatically find the correct file when doing for example:

```shell copy
golem component add
```

## Under the hood

Building Golem components written in Go requires a series of steps.

In details, building the component requires the following steps:

<Steps>
### Generate the Go bindings

Use the `wit-bindgen-go` tool to generate the Go bindings from the WIT files:

```shell
$ go get -tool go.bytecodealliance.org/cmd/wit-bindgen-go
$ go tool wit-bindgen-go generate --out binding --world world-name ./wit
```

### Compile the Go code

Using the TinyGo compiler, compile the Go code into a WebAssembly module:

```shell
$ tinygo build -target=wasip2 -wit-package ./wit -wit-world world-name -tags=purego -o go_example.wasm main.go
```

The resulting WASM file is a **component** ready to be uploaded to Golem.

### Reducing the component's size

The generated component's size can be reduced by stripping some parts of it using the `wasm-tools strip` command:

```shell
$ wasm-tools strip go_example.wasm -o go_example_stripped.wasm
```
