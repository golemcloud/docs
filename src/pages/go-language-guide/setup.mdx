# Setup Go

Creating **Golem components** in **Go** requires using the latest version of the [TinyGo compiler](https://tinygo.org) and installing some common WebAssembly tooling.

## Installing TinyGo

Use the [official guide](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/install/) to install the latest **stable** version of the TinyGo compiler.

<Callout type="info">
  Note that TinyGo also requires Go to be installed too. Follow the recommended steps
  [here](https://go.dev/doc/install) to download and install the **latest** recommended version.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
For MacOS TinyGo can be installed using `brew`:

```bash
brew tap tinygo-org/tools
brew install tinygo
```
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
    The minimum versions assumed by the documentation and templates are the following:
    - TinyGo: 0.37.0
    - Go: 1.24.0
</Callout>

## Install WebAssembly tooling

You will need both `wasm-tools` and `wit-bindgen` to work on Go WebAssembly projects.
Consult the [dedicated page](/installing-webassembly-tooling) for instructions on how to install them.
