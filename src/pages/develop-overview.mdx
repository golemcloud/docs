# Develop an application Golem

Developing an application on golem consists of two major steps:

- Writing one or more **Golem components** in one of the supported programming languages.
- Defining external HTTP endpoints

This page summarizes the workflow of developing an application on Golem, with links to more specific guides for each step.

## Creating an application
The primary tool for developing an application on Golem is the [Golem CLI](/cli).

To create a new application, use the `golem app new` command, passing the name of the application and it's default programming language (note: it is possible to add components using different languages later).

```shell copy
golem app new my-app rust
```

## Writing the code
The application is just a project directory that can contain multiple [components](/concepts/components). To learn how to add a new component and implement it, check the specific guides in this chapter.

### Iterations
During development the whole application can be built using

```shell copy
golem app build
```

and every component can be deployed using

```shell copy
golem app deploy
```

This is going to create a new **version** of each component. If there are workers created already, those are not going to be updated automatically to these new versions. Check the [workers page](/concepts/workers) for more information about updating workers.

## Defining APIs

Most applications require a public HTTP API (but this is not mandatory - you can always use Golem's invocation API to directly communicate with your Golem application).

### Guidelines

Check the [defining custom APIs](/invoke/making-custom-apis) page as a starting point for learning how to define custom APIs.

The recommended way to manage these custom APIs is to create a single API definition YAML in the application's root directory. Future Golem versions will integrate API definitions into the _application manifest_ itself.

### Iterations

Use the `golem api` commands to iterate on your APIs.

<Steps>
### Incrementing the version

Every time you make changes, the API's version must be incremented in the YAML file.

### Uploading

Upload the new API definition using the `golem api upload` command:

```shell copy
golem api definition update api.yaml
```

(Use `golem api definition new api.yaml` the first time)

### Deleting the previous deployment

Before deploying the new API version, the previous deployment must be deleted using the `golem api deployment delete` command:

```shell copy
golem api deployment delete my-definition/0.0.1
```

### Deploying

To try out the actual API, you also have to **deploy** it using the `golem api deploy` command:

```shell copy
golem api deployment deploy my-definition/0.0.2
```

### Breaking the component APIs

When an API is using a component's **exported interface**, it is not possible to deploy a new version of that component if it is breaking that used interface (`golem app deploy` will fail). To resolve this, delete the deployment first as shown above.
