# Building Golem Components in JavaScript

Building Golem components written in JavaScript requires a series of steps.

If the project was created with `golem new`, it already has a `package.json` that incorporates all the necessary steps as _npm scripts_ to build the component, so it is enough to run:

```shell copy
npm run componentize
```

In details, building the component requires the following steps:

<Steps>
### Compile the JavaScript code to JavaScript

The examples use `rollup` through an _npm script_:

```shell
$ npm run build
```

This will compile all the _JavaScript_ sources into a **single** _JavaScript_ file at `out/main.js`.

### Componentizing the JavaScript code

The final step is **componentizing**, which involves:

- embedding our _JavaScript_ code into the _StarlingMonkey JS engine_
- running _Wizer pre-initialization_, which pre-loads and parses our Javascript source in the JS engine
- creating the _wasm output_ file for our component with it's interface exposed as a _WebAssembly component_ usable by _Golem_.

The example projects includes an _npm script_ called `componentize`, which also includes the previous `build` step.

```shell
$ npm run componentize
```

The output wasm file with be created with the built component name, eg.: `out/example.wasm`.

The above _npm script_ will execute the following commands:

```
$ npm run build && jco componentize -w wit -o out/example.wasm out/main.js
```

</Steps>
