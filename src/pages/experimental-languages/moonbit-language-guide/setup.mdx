# Setup development environment for MoonBit

To write **Golem components** in MoonBit, a couple of common WebAssembly tools need to be installed, as well as the latest MoonBit compiler.

## Install WebAssembly tooling

First of all, to install `wasm-tools` via `cargo`, you need to install the latest stable version of Rust. The recommended way to do so is using [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

<Steps>

### Install Rust

Install rustup

```bash copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Install the latest stable version of Rust

```bash copy
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
```

Add the WASI target

```bash copy
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
```

### Install `wasm-tools`

```bash copy
cargo install --force --locked  wasm-tools@1.223.0
```

Confirm the installation:

```bash
wasm-tools --version
wasm-tools 1.223.0
```

### Install `wit-bindgen`

```bash copy
cargo install --force --locked wit-bindgen-cli@0.40.0
```

Confirm the installation:

```bash
wit-bindgen --version
wit-bindgen-cli 0.40.0
```

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Golem requires a **specific version** of `wasm-tools`, and `wit-bindgen`. Please make sure the
  correct version is installed with the commands described above.

## Install MoonBit

Install the latest MoonBit compiler using [the official instructions](https://www.moonbitlang.com/download/). The documentation and examples were created using MoonBit **0.1.20250310**.
