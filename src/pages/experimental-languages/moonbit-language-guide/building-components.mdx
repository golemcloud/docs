# Building Golem Components in MoonBit

Building Golem components having an [application manifest](/app-manifest) is straightforward, just use the `golem` command line interface:

```shell copy
golem app build
```

If the project was created using `golem app new` as recommended, the `golem app build` command will always work as expected.

The result of the `golem app build` command is a WebAssembly component file ready to be uploaded to Golem. It does not have to be specified explicitly, as the `golem` tool will automatically find the correct file when doing for example:

```shell copy
golem component add
```

## Regenerating the stubs
A custom command is provided to regenerate the stubs to be implemented:

```shell copy
golem app regenerate-stubs
```

This command will **rewrite the stub code** in the source directory, removing any existing change into it! Make sure the previous code is copied elsewhere before running this command. It is not mandatory to ever run this command, but then when the exported WIT interface changes, the changes will have to be reflected manually in the source code.

## Under the hood
Building Golem components written in MoonBit involves a few steps.

<Steps>
    ### Generating bindings
    The first step is to generate bindings using `wit-bindgen moonbit`.

    ### Building the component
    Building the component into core WASM module using `moon build --target wasm`.

    ### Embedding the WIT specification
    Before converting the resulting WASM module into a Golem component, the WIT specification is embedded in a custom section using `wasm-tools component embed`.

    ### Converting to a Golem component
    Finally the WASM module is converted into a component using `wasm-tools component new`.
</Steps>
