# Golem CLI Profiles

Profiles are used for golem CLI configuration.
Using different profiles you can use `golem-cli` with multiple installations of an open source Golem and the hosted Golem Cloud at the same time.

## Interactive profile creation

To start interactive profile creation run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli init
```

If you want to specify a custom profile name for an interactive profile creation process - you can use the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli profile init custom-name
```

On the first step you'll see 3 options:

- Golem Default. Use this options for default local docker compose installation.
- Golem. Use this option in case of a customised Golem installation, i.e. a custom `GOLEM_ROUTER_PORT` in `.env` file.
- Golem Cloud. Use this option for a hosted version of Golem.

With Golem Default the hosted Golem Cloud options there are no other specific configuration options.
To specify a custom location for your local open source Golem installation - please use the `Golem` option.

## Non-interactive profile creation

### Hosted Golem Cloud profile

To create a profile for a hosted Golem Cloud use the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli profile add --set-active golem-cloud --default-format json my-profile-name
```

This command creates a new Golem Cloud profile named `my-profile-name` with default output format `json` and sets it as a new active profile.
If you want to keep default output format `text` - you can omit `--default-format json` part. If you don't want to make the new profile as the new active profile - you can omit `--set-active`.

If you are using `golem-cloud-cli` binary you should omit profile type (`golem-cloud`) since `golem-cloud-cli` does not support other profile types:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cloud-cli profile add my-profile-name
```

If you are using the open source specific `golem-cli` without Golem Cloud support - you can't create a Golem Cloud profile.

### Local open source Golem

To create a profile for your local open source Golem installation use the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli profile add --set-active golem --component-url http://localhost:9881 my-oss-profile-name
```

This command creates a new open source Golem profile named `my-oss-profile-name` with both component and worker service location as `http://localhost:9881` and sets it as the new active profile.

Additionally, you can specify `--default-format` option for `json` or `yaml` instead of human-readable `text` and `--worker-url` in case you want to have worker and component services on different locations.

If you are using an open source specific `golem-cli` - you should omit profile type (`golem`). If you are using a Golem Cloud specific `golem-cloud-cli` - you can't create an open source Golem profile.

## Profile authentication

<Callout>This is Golem Cloud specific part.</Callout>

To authentication your Golem Cloud profile you can run any command that requires authentication, i.e. you can run any command that wants to access Golem Cloud servers.
The easiest way to authenticate your profile woutd be to run the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli account get
```

At the moment the only way to authenticate your account is to use Github Oauth2 authorization. Please follow the instructions in your terminal and authorize zivergetech organisation to use OAuth2:

```

```

## Switch profiles

To get the list of your profiles use the following command:

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
golem-cli profile list
```

You'll get all available profiles with the active profile marked by `*`:

```
 * my-oss-profile-name
   my-profile-name
```

Please note that `golem-cli` and `golem-cloud-cli` are using the same profile list, but different active profile.

To switch active profile use `profile switch` command:

```bash
golem-cli profile switch my-profile-name
```

## Golem profile configuration

At the moment the only configurable option is default output format.

To change the default output format for the current active profile you can use `profile config format` command this way:

```bash
golem-cli profile config format text
```

### Output formats

There are 3 output formats:

- text - human-readable format
- json
- yaml

Almost all commands can change output format based on `--format` option or default output format configured for the current active profile.

## Profile configuration files

All `golem-cli` configuration files are stored in `.golem` directory in your home directory. This includes the cached authentication token to your Golem Cloud profile.
It is safe to remove `$HOME/.golem` directory in case of any issues with profiles - you will keep access to your Golem Cloud account as log as you have access to your Github account linked to your Golem Cloud account.
