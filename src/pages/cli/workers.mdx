# Golem CLI Workers

Using `golem worker` command you can:

- Start and stop worker
- Interrupt and resume workers
- Invoke worker function
- Get worker stdout, stderr and logs
- Update workers
- Search workers, get metadata, etc.
- Revert a worker to a previous state

<Callout>
  In all examples we are using component URN. You can use component URL or `--component-name`
  instead.
</Callout>

## Start new worker

Even though workers can automatically start on the first invocation, it is possible to explicitly start a worker.
This allows specifying command line arguments and environment variables for the worker.

```shell copy
golem worker new example:counter/counter1 --env A=1 --env B=2 arg1 arg2
```

You can see the URN for your new worker in command output. You can use URN whenever you want to specify worker instead of component and worker name.

## Get worker metadata

### Using worker name

You can get worker metadata using worker name and (optionally prefixed by the component name, if it is not inferrable from the current context):

```shell copy
golem worker get counter1
golem worker get example:counter/counter1
```

## Search workers

You can search for workers of some components using `worker list` command with repeated `--filter` argument.

For instance lets find idle workers with component version older than 2 of the component `example:counter`:

```shell copy
golem worker list --filter "status = Idle" --filter "version < 2" example:counter
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Enumerating workers is a slow operation and should only be used for debugging an administrative
  tasks.
</Callout>

## Invoke functions

The folowig section shows the basics of invoking workers through the CLI. See the [dedicated invocation with CLI page](/invoke/cli) for more details.

### Without waiting for result

You can invoke worker function without waiting for function result using `worker invoke --enqueue` command:

```shell copy
golem worker invoke --enqueue counter1 'rpc:counters/api.{inc-global-by}' 5
```

Function parameters can be specified using repeated `--arg` parameters.

### Waiting for result

You can invoke worker function and wait for result using `worker invoke` command:

```shell copy
golem worker invoke counter1 'rpc:counters/api.{get-global-value}'
```

```
Invocation results in WAVE format:
- '5'
```

### Ephemeral workers

Invoking **ephemeral components** does not require specifying the worker name, as Golem creates a new instance for each invocation. In this case only the **component** must be selected (if it is not inferred by the context), and the worker name must be `-`:

```shell copy
golem worker invoke example:ephemeral-component/- 'demo:worker/api.{test}'
```

### Using idempotency key

If you want to make sure function was called only once even if you called CLI multiple times (for instance due to retries on network errors) you can use `--idempotency-key` parameter for both `invoke` and `invoke-and-await` commands.

You can use any string as idempotency key.

## Live streaming worker logs

You can connect to your running worker and get logs using `worker connect` command this way:

```shell copy
golem worker connect counter1
```

You can also use `--connect` option on `invoke` command to connect to worker right after invoking the command.

## Worker update

To update worker to some specific version of worker component you can use `worker update` this way:

```shell copy
golem worker update counter1 --target-version 2 --mode auto
```

You can also use `worker update-many` with the same `--filter` parameters as in `worker list` command to update multiple workers:

```shell copy
golem worker update-many example:counter --filter 'version < 2' --target-version 2 --mode auto
```

## Interrupt and resume workers

If you want to interrupt and later resume a long-running worker you can use `interrupt` and `resume` commands:

```shell copy
golem worker interrupt counter1
golem worker resume counter1
```

## Testing worker crash recovery

There is a special command to simulate unexpected worker crush and recovery - `worker simulated-crash`. This command can be used for tests:

```shell copy
golem worker simulated-crash counter1
```

## Stopping workers

Idle worker are not actively consuming resources but they take storage as their state is persisted. A worker can be deleted using the `worker delete` command:

```shell copy
golem worker delete counter1
```

This command deletes worker state.

Please note that even though the worker can be deleted this way it would be started again (with the fresh state) if used:

```shell
golem worker delete counter1
golem worker invoke counter1 'rpc:counters/api.{get-global-value}'
```

```
Invocation results in WAVE format:
- '0'
```

## Oplog query

It is possible to **query** an existing worker's oplog for debugging purposes. To get the **full oplog** of a worker, use the `worker oplog` command the worker must be specified just like in other `golem-cli worker` commands:

```shell copy
golem worker oplog counter1
```

Any other form of identifying a worker can be used (URL syntax, separate component-id and worker name, etc).

With the optional `--from` parameter it is possible to only get oplog entries _after_ a certain oplog index:

```shell copy
golem worker oplog counter1
```

Oplog entries are indexed from 1, and the first entry is always a **create** entry that defines the initial state of the worker.

### Searching for oplog entries

The same command can also be used to **search** for oplog entries, using the `--query` parameter. This parameter requries a query using **lucene query syntax**. The following syntax elements are supported:

- `search terms` looks for `search` AND `terms`
- `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`
- grouping using parentheses `()`
- `"quoted terms"`
- regular expression matches using `/regex/`
- `field:value` to search for a specific information

The terms and fields are interpreted in the following way:

| Oplog entry                 | Matching queries                                                                                                                              |

The cases marked with **(\*)** can use the `field:value` syntax to look into the typed, structured parameter and result values.

For example to look for oplog entries that contain parameters or return values of **exported functions** where any of these input/output values is a **record** having a field `product-id` with either value `123` or `456`, we can use the following query:

```shell
golem worker oplog --worker urn:worker:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799/counter1 --query 'exported-function AND (product-id:123 OR product-id:456)'
```

## Reverting a worker

It is possible to revert a worker to its previous state. This can be useful if a worker got into a **failed** state to make it usable again, or to undo some accidental invocations or updates.

There are two possible ways to specify which state to revert to:

- **By index**: The index of the oplog entry to revert to. Use the **oplog query** command to check the worker's oplog and find the index of the desired state.
- **By undoing the last invocations**: The given number is the number of invocations to revert.

To revert to a given oplog, use the `worker revert` command:

```shell copy
golem worker revert counter1 --last-oplog-index 42
```

To revert some of the last invocations, use the `--number-of-invocations` parameter instead:

```shell copy
golem worker revert counter1 --number-of-invocations 3
```
