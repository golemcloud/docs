# Golem Application Manifest

The _Golem Application Manifest_ document format is used by `golem`, usually stored in files named `golem.yaml`, and they are the intended way to define, build, deploy and manage Golem Applications and Environments.

The Application Manifest uses _YAML_ format, see the [reference](/app-manifest) for more information on the schema and for the field reference.

# Application Manifest Quickstart

Application manifest documents can be explicitly passed as `golem` arguments, but the recommended way to use them is with _auto discovery_ mode: when `golem` is called with an application manifest compatible command it keeps searching for `golem.yaml` documents in current working directory and parent directories. Once it found the top level `golem.yaml` document, more documents are searched using the [includes](/app-manifest#fields_includes) field.

Once all manifest documents are found, the paths in them are resolved based on their directory, and then the documents are merged. For the field specific merge rules see the [field reference](/app-manifest#field-reference).

## Using component templates

Golem projects can be created with `golem new` command. This creates a new application that may consist of multiple components. To add a new component to an existing application, use `golem component new`. E.g.: let's add a new _c_ and _ts_ component in a new and empty directory:

```shell
golem new myapp rust
cd myapp
golem component new rust app:component-a
golem component new ts app:component-b
```

When using the `app new` command, it will create:

- common directory for the given language (`common-rust` and `common-ts`):
- this directory contains the languages specific _Application Manifest Template_, which defines how to
build the components
- can be used for shared subprojects
- might contain other shared configurations
- directory for components for the given language (`components-rust` and `components-ts`)

Let's rename one of the generated agents, so they are unique for the deployment. In `components-ts/app-component-b/src/main.ts` change:

```diff
- class CounterAgent extends BaseAgent {
+ class OtherCounterAgent extends BaseAgent {
```

and in `components-ts/app-component-b/golem.yaml`:
```diff
-             let agent = counter-agent(name);
+             let agent = other-counter-agent(name);
```

Now that we added our components, let's use the `golem` command list our project metadata:

```shell
$ golem

## Starting the local development server

The `golem` CLI also includes a local development server that can be used to quickly develop, deploy, test and debug Golem applications locally.
To start the server use:
```shell
golem server run
```

The above command will quickly boot the server, and then it will keep logging to the terminal, so let's switch to another terminal to continue with building and deploying our application..

## Building and deploying the application

Because the _ts_ components use npm, we have to use `npm install` before building the components. We can also see that this has a wrapper custom command in the manifest called `npm-install`, and `golem` itself will automatically run it before a build. Let's see an example for both:

```sh
$ golem exec npm-install
<..>
$ golem build
Collecting sources
  Found sources: /Users/<...>/app-demo/common-rust/golem.yaml, /Users/<...>/app-demo/common-ts/golem.yaml, /Users/<...>/app-demo/components-rust/app-component-a/golem.yaml, /Users/<...>/app-demo/components-ts/app-component-b/golem.yaml, /Users/<...>/app-demo/golem.yaml
Collecting components
  Found components: app:component-a, app:component-b
Resolving application wit directories
  Resolving component wit dirs for app:component-a (/Users/<...>/app-demo/components-rust/app-component-a/wit, /Users/<...>/app-demo/components-rust/app-component-a/wit-generated)
  Resolving component wit dirs for app:component-b (/Users/<...>/app-demo/components-ts/app-component-b/wit, /Users/<...>/app-demo/components-ts/app-component-b/wit-generated)
Selecting profiles, no profile was requested
  Selected default profile debug for app:component-a using template cpp
  Selected default build for app:component-b using template ts
<...>
Linking RPC
  Copying app:component-a without linking, no static WASM RPC dependencies were found
  Copying app:component-b without linking, no static WASM RPC dependencies were found
```

Then we can check that the components are built:

```sh
$ ls golem-temp/components
app_component_a_debug.wasm app_component_b.wasm
```

To deploy the application, including all the components, we can use

```sh copy
golem deploy
```

in the application root folder, and the CLI will apply all changes required.

Note that `golem deploy` will also always implicitly check for source changes, and based on that will automatically build any changed components, so usually we can just run `golem deploy`.

If we want to only build some components, we can do so by explicitly selecting them with the `--component-name` flag, or we can implicitly select them by changing our current working directory, e.g.:

```shell
$ cd components-rust
$ golem
<...>
Components:
  app:component-a
    Selected:     yes
    Source:       /Users/noise64/workspace/examples/app-demo/components-rust/app-component-a/golem.yaml
    Template:     cpp
    Profiles:     debug, release
  app:component-b
    Selected:     no
    Source:       /Users/noise64/workspace/examples/app-demo/components-ts/app-component-b/golem.yaml
    Template:     ts
<...>
```

Notice how only app:component-a is selected in the above example, the same selection logic is used when building.
On the other hand, deploying _will always deploy the whole application atomically_, so it is ensured that all our agents
are up-to-date.

When developing locally, it is often useful to drop all our existing durable agents and have a fresh clean environment
for testing. For this, use:

```shell
golem deploy --reset
```

## Targeting Golem Cloud, or other environments
By default, most `golem` commands will target the local Golem server.

To access Golem's own hosted _Golem Cloud_ (or other custom installations), we can simply use the same commands as before
but select the cloud environment with one of the following ways:
```shell
# Explicitly selecting the cloud (or a custom) environment
golem --enviroment cloud deploy
golem -E cloud deploy

# Using the convenience cloud flag:
golem --cloud deploy
golem -C build

# Or by using environment variables, which can be useful in CI/CD pipelines:
export GOLEM_ENVIRONMENT=cloud
golem deploy
```
