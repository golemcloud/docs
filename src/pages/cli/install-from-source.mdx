# Golem CLI installation from source

If the precompiled binaries are not available for your platform, or prefer to install from source, you can build it with the Rust toolchain,

## Prerequisites
To build `golem-cli` you need to use `cargo`, Rust's build tool, and the build will require `protoc`, the [protobuf](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf) compiler.

To get `cargo` on your system, we recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable
rustup default stable
```

To install `protoc` see [https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/](https://grpc.io/docs/protoc-installation/).
Make sure to install version **3.15 or higher**.

## Installing `golem-cli`

The `golem-cli` command is the more lightweight version of Golem's command line interface, that allows you to interact with a running Golem cluster but it does not have a built-in local version of Golem itself.

To install `golem-cli` from source, use `cargo install`:

```bash copy
cargo install golem-cli --locked
```

This will create a binary file named `golem-cli` in the `~/.cargo/bin` directory.

## Installing `golem`

The `golem` binary is the full version of Golem's command line interface, containing everything `golem-cli` has and also has a built-in local version of Golem itself.

The `golem` package is not published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/) so in order to install it from source, follow the steps below.
