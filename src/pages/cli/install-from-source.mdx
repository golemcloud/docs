# Golem CLI installation from source

If the precompiled binaries are not available for your platform, or you prefer to install from source, you can build it with the Rust toolchain.

## Prerequisites
To build `golem-cli` you need to use `cargo`, Rust's build tool.

To get `cargo` on your system, we recommend using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/):

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
rustup install stable
rustup default stable
```

## Installing `golem-cli`

The `golem-cli` command is the lightweight version of Golem's command line interface, which allows you to interact with a running Golem cluster, but it does not include a built-in local version of Golem itself.

To install `golem-cli` from source, use `cargo install`:

```bash copy
cargo install golem-cli --git https://github.com/golemcloud/golem --tag v1.3.0-rc8
```

<Callout type="warning">
    Note that currently installing from crates.io is not possible because the package requires a patched wasmtime version. Always use the `--git` parameter or our precompiled binaries.
</Callout>

This will create a binary file named `golem-cli` in the `~/.cargo/bin` directory.

## Installing `golem`

The `golem` binary is the full version of Golem's command line interface, containing everything `golem-cli` has, and it also includes a built-in local version of Golem itself.

The `golem` package is not published to [crates.io](https://crates.io/), so to install it from source, follow the steps below.
