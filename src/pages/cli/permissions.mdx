# Golem CLI Permissions

<Callout type="info">This page only applies to the hosted **Golem Cloud**.</Callout>

## Tokens

Tokens are API keys that allow accessing **Golem Cloud** APIs from external services. The `golem-cloud-cli` tool allows managing these tokens.
To manage them programmatically, check [the token API](/rest-api/cloud-rest-api/token).

### Listing existing tokens

The following command lists all the tokens associated with your account:

```shell copy
golem token list
```

### Creating a new token

To create a new token, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem token add
```

```
New token created with id 08bc0eac-5c51-40a5-8bc6-5c8928efb475 and expiration date 2100-01-01 00:00:00 UTC.
Please save this token secret, you can't get this data later:
64cf566c-ed72-48e5-b786-b88aa0298fb4
```

Optionally, an expiration date can be specified with `--expires-at`. If not specified, default expiration date is `2100-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`.

### Deleting a token

Each token has a **token ID**. Use the `token delete` command to remove a token using it's identifier:

```shell copy
golem token delete 08bc0eac-5c51-40a5-8bc6-5c8928efb475
```

## Project sharing

On **Golem Cloud** components are organized into **projects**.

### Listing projects

Existing projects can be listed using the `project list` subcommand:

```shell copy
golem project list
```

### Adding projects

A new project can be created using `project add`. The command expects a project name and description:

```shell copy
golem project add --project-name "Golem Demo" --project-description "A new project for demonstrating the project feature"
```

When creating components or workers, the project can be specified with the `--project-name` flag. Every user has a **default project** which is used when no explicit project is specified.

### Sharing projects with other accounts

Projects can be shared among multiple Golem Cloud accounts.

To share a project, use the `share` subcommand:

```shell copy
golem share --project-name "Golem Demo" --recipient-account-id 08bc0eac-5c51-40a5-8bc6-5c8928efb475 --project-actions ViewWorker --project-actions ViewComponent
```

This example shares the "Golem Demo" project with the account identified by `08bc0eac-5c51-40a5-8bc6-5c8928efb475` and grants component and worker **view** permissions for it.

<Callout>
  Alternatively it is possible to create and manage **project policies** using the `project-policy`
  subcommand, and refer to these policies in the `share` command later.
</Callout>

The following table lists all the **actions** that can be granted to a project:

| Action                | Description                                   |

| `DeleteComponent`     | Delete components                             |
| `ViewWorker`          | List and get metadata of workers              |
| `CreateWorker`        | Create new workers                            |

| `CreateProjectGrants` | Grant more access for the project             |

| `ViewApiDefinition`   | View API definitions                          |
| `CreateApiDefinition` | Create new API definitions                    |
