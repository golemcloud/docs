# Golem CLI Plugins

## Manage the available plugins

To manage the plugins available for installation, use the `golem plugin` commands.

See the [Plugins page](/concepts/plugins) for general information about Golem plugins.

### List the available plugins

To list the available plugins, use the `golem plugin list` command.

```shell copy
golem plugin list
```

Plugins can be installed to different **scopes**. By default the command lists the plugins installed in the **global scope**.

Use the following options to list plugins in other scopes:

- `--project <PROJECT_NAME>`: List plugins installed in the given project's scope
- `--component <COMPONENT_NAME>`: List plugins installed in the given component's scope.

### Get information about a registered plugin

To get more information about one of the available plugins, use the `golem plugin get` command:

```shell copy
golem plugin get <PLUGIN_NAME> <PLUGIN_VERSION>
```

### Register a new plugin

Plugins are identified by their name and version. To register a new plugin, use the `golem plugin register` command:

```shell copy
golem plugin register <MANIFEST_PATH>
```

The parameter should point to a **plugin manifest YAML** describing all the properties of the plugin.

#### The plugin manifest

The plugin manifest consists of the following required global fields:

| field name | description |
|------------|-------------|
| `name`     | The name of the plugin |
| `version`  | The version of the plugin |
| `description` | A short description of the plugin |
| `icon`     | Path to the plugin's icon |
| `homepage` | URL to the plugin's homepage |

The details of the plugin are specified in the `specs` field, which is an object.

The `specs.type` field specifies the type of the plugin. It can be one of the following:

- `ComponentTransformer`: The plugin is a component transformer plugin.
- `OplogProcessor`: The plugin is an oplog processor plugin.
- `App`: The plugin is an application plugin.
- `Library`: The plugin is a library plugin.

The rest of the fields of the `spec` object depend on the plugin type.

**ComponentTransformer fields**

| field name | required | description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `providedWitPackage` | No | The path to the WIT file describing the extra provided interfaces the plugin adds |
| `jsonSchema` | No | The path to the JSON schema file describing the plugin's configuration fields |
| `validateUrl`| Yes| URL to the external component transformation service's validate endpoint |
| `transformUrl`| Yes| URL to the external component transformation service's transform endpoint |

**OplogProcessor fields**

| field name | required | description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `component` | Yes | The path to the oplog processor component (WASM) |

**App fields**

| field name | required | description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `component` | Yes | The path to the application component (WASM) |

**Library fields**

| field name | required | description |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| `component` | Yes | The path to the library component (WASM) |

### Unregister a plugin

To unregister an available plugin, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem plugin unregister --plugin-name <PLUGIN-NAME> --version <PLUGIN-VERSION>
```

## Manage a component's plugins using the app manifest

The recommended way to apply plugins to components is to define them in the **app manifest**.

The set of **installed plugins** can be set for each component in the app manifest under the `plugins` key:

```yaml
components:
  my:example:
      template: ts
      plugins:
          - name: component-transformer-1
            version: v1
            parameters:
              x: 1
              y: 2
```

The `name` and `version` fields of each installed component must match one of the available components installed to the system with the `golem plugin` commands described above.

The `parameters` field contains an arbitrary set of key-value pairs, their meaning depending on the actual plugin.

It is possible to install *multiple plugins* to a component, and the order they are going to be applied is going to match the order of the elements in the app manifest.

To apply the changes, use one of the `golem app deploy` or the `golem component deploy` commands.

## Manage a component's plugins explicitly

There are CLI commands to explicitly install, uninstall or update a component's set of installed plugins. These commands may get deprecated in the future in favor of using the app manifest as described above.

A subset of the registered plugins can be installed for a component using te `golem component plugin` commands.

### Get the installed plugins

To get the list of installed plugins for a component, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem component plugin get <COMPONENT-NAME> <VERSION>
```

### Install a plugin

To install a plugin for a component, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem component plugin install --plugin-name <PLUGIN_NAME> --plugin-version <PLUGIN_VERSION> --priority <PRIORITY> [COMPONENT_NAME]
```

Many plugins require per-installation **configuration**. These are key-value pairs that can be passed as arguments to the `install` command as `--param <KEY=VAL>`.

The **priority** is a number that determines the order in which plugins are applied.

### Uninstall a plugin

To uninstall a plugin from a component, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem component plugin uninstall --installation-id <INSTALLATION_ID> [COMPONENT_NAME]
```

The **installation ID** is a unique identifier assigned every time a plugin is installed for a component. It is not enough to use the plugin name and version here, because one plugin can be installed multiple times (for exampel with different configuration) for a component.

### Updating a plugin's priority or configuration

To update a plugin's priority or set of configuration parameters, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem component plugin update --installation-id <INSTALLATION_ID> --priority <NEW_PRIORITY> --param <KEY=VALUE> [...--param <KEY=VALUE>] [COMPONENT_NAME]
```

The **installation ID** is a unique identifier assigned every time a plugin is installed to a given component version, or its configuration has been changed.

## Manage a project's plugins

In _Golem Cloud_ it is also possible to install plugins for a **project**. Every component created in the project will get the installed plugins from the project.

### Get the installed plugins

To get the list of installed plugins for a project, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem project plugin get [PROJECT_NAME]
```

The `PROJECT_NAME` parameter can be either a project's name (if it is not ambigous), or it can be prefixed by the project's owner account's email address.

### Install a plugin

To install a plugin for a project, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem project plugin install --plugin-name <PLUGIN_NAME> --plugin-version <PLUGIN_VERSION> --priority <PRIORITY> --param <KEY=VALUE> [...--param <KEY=VALUE>] [PROJECT_NAME]
```

Many plugins require per-installation **configuration**. These are key-value pairs that can be passed as arguments to the `install` command as `--param <KEY=VAL>`.

The **priority** is a number that determines the order in which plugins are applied.

### Uninstall a plugin

To uninstall a plugin from a project, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem project plugin uninstall --installation-id <INSTALLATION_ID> [COMPONENT_NAME]
```

The **installation ID** is a unique identifier assigned every time a plugin is installed for a component. It is not enough to use the plugin name and version here, because one plugin can be installed multiple times (for exampel with different configuration) for a component.
```

### Updating a plugin's priority or configuration

To update a plugin's priority or set of configuration parameters, use the following command:

```shell copy
golem project plugin update --installation-id <INSTALLATION_ID> --priority <NEW_PRIORITY> --param <KEY=VALUE> [...--param <KEY=VALUE>] [PROJECT_NAME]
```

The **installation ID** is a unique identifier assigned every time a plugin is installed to a given component version, or its configuration has been changed.
