# Golem CLI Components

[Golem components](/concepts/components) are WASM components deployed to Golem for execution.

To create, list, build and deploy components you can use `golem component` command.

## Creating a new component

To create a new component in an application directory (previously created with `golem app new`) use the `component new` command in the following way:

```shell copy
golem component new <template-name> <component-name>
```

To see all the available component templates, just run the command without providing one.

This command only modifies the source code of the application, does not create anything on the server.

## Building a component

To build a component, use the `component build` command in the following way:

```shell copy
golem component build <component-name>
```

To build the whole application, use the `app build` command in the following way:

```shell copy
golem app build
```

Both commands accept a `--build-profile <BUILD_PROFILE>` argument. Some of the built-in templates define a separate `release` profile which creates a more optimized version of the components. Build profiles can be fully customized by editing the _application manifest files_.

## Deploying a component

To deploy a component, use the `component deploy` or `app deploy` commands in the following way:

```shell copy
golem component deploy <component-name>
```
or

```shell copy
golem app deploy <component-name>
```

to deploy a specific component only.

The output of the command will be something like the following:
```
New component created with URN urn:component:d8bc9194-a4a2-4a57-8545-43408fc38799, version 0, and size of 89735 bytes.
Component name: my-component.
Exports:
        rpc:counters/api.{[constructor]counter}(name: string) -> handle<0>
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.inc-by}(self: &handle<0>, value: u64)
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.get-value}(self: &handle<0>) -> u64
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.get-args}(self: &handle<0>) -> list<string>
        rpc:counters/api.{[method]counter.get-env}(self: &handle<0>) -> list<tuple<string, string>>
        rpc:counters/api.{inc-global-by}(value: u64)
        rpc:counters/api.{get-global-value}() -> u64
        rpc:counters/api.{get-all-dropped}() -> list<tuple<string, u64>>
        rpc:counters/api.{bug-wasm-rpc-i32}(in: variant { leaf }) -> variant { leaf }
        rpc:counters/api.{[drop]counter}(self: handle<0>)
```

The returned output contains the following information:

- **Component URN** - URN for the new component. You can use this URN whenever you want to specify the component instead of component name.
- **Component version** - incremental component version - used for updating the agents.
- **Component size** - size of the `wasm` file - it is important for the storage limit in the hosted Golem Cloud.
- **Exports** - exported function you can call. You can copy function name (the part before parameters) to call the function. All Golem API expect function names in exactly this format. See the [name mapping page](/name-mapping) for more details.

To deploy **all components** of an application, use:

```shell copy
golem app deploy
```

To deploy the **component** based on the current directory, use:

```shell copy
golem component deploy
```

### Ephemeral components

Components created are **durable** by default. To create an **ephemeral component** instead, change the component's application manifest (`golem.yaml`) to contain:

```yaml
components:
  example:component:
    componentType: ephemeral
```

## Component search

### Using component name and the latest version

If you want to get the latest version of the component using its name you can you can use the `component get` command.

```shell copy
golem get example:component
```

### Using component name and specific version

To get a specific version of a component, just pass the desired version number as well:

```shell copy
golem get example:component 2
```

### Getting component list

To get all component versions for specific component name you can use `component list` command with a given component name. Note if you are in a component's source directory, the command will automatically list that component's versions.

```shell copy
golem component list example:component
```

To get all component available you can use `component list` command this way:

```shell copy
golem component list
```

<Callout>
  If you want to restrict component search to some specific project on Golem Cloud you can specify
  project via `--project` or `--project-name` option. It works for all commands that accept
  `--component-name` parameter.
</Callout>

## Updating component

To update a component just run the `component deploy` (or `app deploy`) command again.

If you want to trigger an update all agents to the new latest version right after creating this version you can use `--try-update-agents` option.

It is possible to change the **component's type** (from durable to ephemeral, or from ephemeral to durable) when
updating the component by changing the manifest file.

## Updating agents

If you want to update all agents you can use `component try-update-agents` command.

This command gets all agents for the component that are not using the latest version and triggers an update for them one by one:

```shell copy
golem component try-update-agents example:component
```

The update request is enqueued and processed by the agents asynchronously, `golem` cannot await for the update to finish.

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that automatic agent update is not guaranteed to succeed, if the updated component differs
  too much from the previous one.
</Callout>

<Callout>You can use URL or `--component-name` instead.</Callout>

## Redeploying agents

During the development of a Golem Component, it is often necessary to quickly rebuild the code, update the component and just restart all the test agents from scratch to test the changes.

This is different from updating the agents as they will loose their state, but it can speed up the feedback loop during development.

This workflow is supported by the `component redeploy` command:

```shell copy
golem component redeploy example:component
```

This command deletes all agents that are not using the latest version of component and re-creates them with the same name, parameters and environment variables.

<Callout>You can use URL or `--component-name` instead.</Callout>
