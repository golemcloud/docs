# Golem CLI Introduction

Golem CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with Golem. Golem CLI allows users to upload their components, launch new agents based on these components and call functions on running agents.

## Golem CLI versions
There are precompiled binaries of two variants of the CLI:

- `golem` is the full version of the command line interface, including a locally runnable version of Golem itself.
- `golem-cli` is a lightweight version of the command line interface, requiring a running Golem cluster.

In this documentation we will use the `golem` command in the snippets.

## Installation

There are two ways to install any of the above described versions of Golem CLI:

- Downloading a precompiled platform-specific binary
- Installing from source using Rust tooling

### Downloading precompiled binaries

You can download the precompiled version of `golem` (and `golem-cli`) from the following pages:

<Callout type="info">
  Some platforms may prevent downloaded binaries from running by default. You may need to
  allow them in your system settings.

### Installing from source

It is also possible to build it from source for yourself using Rust tooling. Refer to [the page about building Golem CLI for yourself](/cli/install-from-source) for more information.

## Profiles

The Golem CLI can have multiple profiles configured, each selecting a specific Golem cluster to connect to, as well as some settings like the default output format.

See the [Golem CLI profiles page](/cli/profiles) for more information.

## Working with components

Golem CLI can manage components. See the [Golem CLI components page](/cli/components) for details.

## Interacting with agents

Golem CLI allows creating, invoking and observing [agents](/concepts/agents). See the [Golem CLI agents page](/cli/agents) for more information.
