# Golem CLI Introduction

Golem CLI is a command-line interface for interacting with Golem. Golem CLI allows users to upload their components, launch new workers based on these components and call functions on running workers.

## Golem CLI versions
There are precompiled binaries of two variants of the CLI here:

- `golem` is the full version of the command line interface, including a locally runnable version of Golem itself.
- `golem-cli` is a lightweight version of the command line interface, requiring a running Golem cluster

In this documentation we will use the `golem` command in the snippets.

## Installation

There are two ways to install any of the above described versions of Golem CLI:

- Downloading a precompiled platform-specific binary
- Installing from source using Rust tooling

### Downloading precompiled binaries

You can download the precompiled version of `golem` (and `golem-cli`) from the following pages:

<Cards num={1}>
  <Card
    title="Golem CLI Releases"
    href="https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-cli/releases"
  />
</Cards>

We provide precompiled binaries for the following platforms:

- Mac arm64
- Mac x86_6
- Linux arm64
- Linux x86_64
- Windows x86_64

<Callout type="info">
  Some platforms may protect by default from running these downloaded binaries. You may need to
  allow running them in your system settings.
</Callout>

### Installing from source

It is also possible to build it from source for yourself using Rust tooling. Refer to [the page about building Golem CLI for yourself](/cli/install-from-source) for more information.

## Profiles

The Golem CLI can have multiple profiles configured, each selecting a specific Golem cluster to connect to, as well as some settings like the default output format.

See the [Golem CLI profiles page](cli/profiles) for more information.

## Working with components

Golem CLI can manage [Golem Components](concepts/components). See the [Golem CLI components page](cli/components) for details.

## Interacting with workers

Golem CLI allows creating, invoking and observing [Golem Workers](concepts/workers). See the [Golem CLI workers page](cli/workers) for more information.
