# Invocation Context

Golem associates an **invocation context** with each agent invocation. This invocation context consists of a stack of **spans**, each having a collection of **attributes**. Currently only string attributes are supported.

The invocation context can be queried and manipulated (by adding custom spans with custom attributes) using [the SDK](/develop/additional).

By default, the invocation context's spans are not used by Golem for anything; they are just information propagated among agents to be used by either the agents or **oplog processor plugins** installed to them. It is possible to reconstruct all information about invocation context from the oplog, so oplog processor plugins can be used, for example, to provide live traces of agents through OpenTelemetry.

## Automatic invocation context spans

### Incoming HTTP requests
The root spans of an invocation contain information depending on how that invocation was started. When invoking through the [invocation REST API](/invoke/http), [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) headers are automatically processed to set the root **trace-id** and **parent span-id**.

When using [custom APIs](/invoke/making-custom-apis), the same headers are also taken into account by default, but it is also possible to write a **custom Rib script** per endpoint to extract more information from the HTTP requests and define custom **span attributes** with them.

In both cases, when the invocation's trigger is an HTTP request, a span is added with the following attributes:

- `request.method`
- `request.uri`
- `request.remote_addr`

### Invocations
When an invocation reaches an agent, a new span is created containing the following attributes:

- `name`: span's name (`invoke-exported-function`)
- `idempotency_key`: unique identifier of the invocation
- `function_name`: the fully qualified function name
- `worker_id`: worker's ID (consists of component ID and agent ID)
- `agent_type`: the agent type of this agent
- `agent_parameters`: constructor parameter values of the agent

### Outgoing HTTP requests
Outgoing HTTP requests are also represented by their own automatic spans with the following attributes:

- `name`: span's name (`outgoing-http-request`)
- `request.method`: the outgoing request's HTTP method
- `request.uri`: the outgoing request's URI

### RPC calls
RPC calls on the caller side are also represented by custom spans. First, a span is created when the underlying RPC resource is initialized, with the following attributes:

- `name`: span's name (`rpc-connection`)
- `target_worker_id`: the target worker's ID

Within this span, a new span is created for each remote invocation, with the following attributes:

- `name`: span's name (`rpc-invocation`)
- `function_name`: the invoked function's fully qualified name
- `idempotency_key`: the unique identifier of the invocation
