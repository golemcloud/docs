# WASM-RPC

<Callout type="warning">
  Prefer the typed approaches to worker-invocation explained in the
  [introduction](/docs/worker-to-worker-communication). This section describes the underlying
  interfaces that are used by golem itself to implement the typed approaches to RPC.
</Callout>

The low-level interface to invoke other workers from within a component is the [WASM-RPC](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/blob/main/wit/deps/wasm-rpc/wasm-rpc.wit) wit package.
The basic workflow of using this package is to construct an instance of the `wasm-rpc` resource (which represents a remote worker) and call the appropriate method on it.

## Constructing an instance

There are two constructors for creating the `wasm-rpc` resource:

- The default constructor takes a `worker-id` as a parameter
- The `ephemeral` constructor takes a `component-id` as a parameter

## WIT-Value

As the wasm-rpc package is not statically typed, it is required to be able to pass as arguments and return arbitrary WIT values. This is done using the WIT-Value datatype which is a reified
version of the regular WIT types. There is one constructor of the related WIT-Node type for each type in the WIT typesystem, i.e. a `list<u64>` with value `[1, 2, 4]` might be represented like this in a rust component using wasm-rpc:

```rust
WitValue {
      nodes: vec![WitNode::ListValue(vec![1, 2, 3]), WitNode::PrimU64(1), WitNode::PrimU64(2), WitNode::PrimU64(4)]
}
```

<Callout type="info">
  The value that will end up becoming the root of the resulting WIT Value needs to be placed in
  index 0 of the nodes array!
</Callout>

All functions in the wasm-rpc package use wit-value instead of the equivalent wit type. Invoking a function with incorrect wit-values with lead to an error.

## Invocation

After you have constructed an instance of wasm-rpc there are a number of different functions you can choose from, depending on the invocation semantics you need.

- `invoke`: Non-blockingly call the desired function. Errors during invocation are returned, but the actual result of the invocation cannot be accessed.
- `invoke-and-await`: Blockingly call the desired function. The result of the invocation will be returned to you.
- `async-invoke-and-await`: Non-blockingly call the desired function. A resource will be returned to you that you can use to poll the result.
- `schedule-invocation`: Schedule an invocation for a point in time in the future.
- `schedule-cancelable-invocation`: Schedule an invocation for a point in time in the future. A resource will be returned to you that you can cancel the invocation as long as it hasn't been executed yet.

## Example

Given the following WIT world implemented by a component:

```wit
package golem:example;

interface invocation-example-api {
  add: func(value: u64);
}

world invocation-example {
  export invocation-example-api;
}
```

A rust component could use the wasm-rpc package to schedule an invocation of 'add' 2 seconds in the future like this:

```rust
let worker_id = WorkerId { component_id, worker_name }
let rpc = WasmRpc::new(&worker_id);

let now = OffsetDateTime::now_utc();

let scheduled_time = now.saturating_add(Duration::seconds(2));

let scheduled_wasi_time = WasiDatetime {
   seconds: scheduled_time.unix_timestamp() as u64,
   nanoseconds: scheduled_time.nanosecond()
};

let value: WitValue = {
   use self::bindings::golem::rpc::types::*;
   WitValue {
         nodes: vec![WitNode::PrimU64(1)]
   }
};
rpc.schedule_invocation(scheduled_wasi_time, "golem:example/invocation-example-api.{add}()", &vec![value]);
```
