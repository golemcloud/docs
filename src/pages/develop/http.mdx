# HTTP requests

Golem implements the [WASI HTTP](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http) interfaces so any library built on this specification can be used from Golem components to communicate with external services.
HTTP request can also be made with the JavaScript standard builtin `fetch` function.
