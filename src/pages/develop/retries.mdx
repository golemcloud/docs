# Control the retry policy

### Using Golem's retry mechanism

Golem applies a retry mechanism to all agents. In case of a failure, Golem will automatically recover the agent to the point before the failure and retry the operation. An exponential backoff and an upper limit on the number of retries are applied.

If the maximum number of retries is reached, the agent will be marked as failed and no further invocations will be possible on it.

This mechanism is automatic and applied to all kinds of failures. To rely on it, throw an unhandled exception.

<Callout type="warning">
    Golem will retry from the point the unhandled exception was thrown. It is possible that a previous operation's
    unwanted result (if it did not end in an exception) has been already persisted, in which case it won't be retried.
</Callout>

### Customizing the retry policy

The retry policy which controls the maximum number of retries and the exponential backoff is a global configuration of the Golem servers, but it can be customized for each agent.

        The `golem-ts-sdk` library exports the `withRetryPolicy` function to temporarily change the retry policy:

        ```typescript
        import {withRetryPolicy} from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

        // Durations are expected as nanoseconds
        const result: string = withRetryPolicy(
        {
            maxAttempts: 3,
            minDelay: BigInt(100 * 1000 * 1000), // 100 milliseconds
            maxDelay: BigInt(2 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000), // 2 seconds
            multiplier: 1.5,
            maxJitterFactor: null,
        },
        () => {
            // this closure runs with the custom retry policy
            return "hello"
        })
        ```

        The `RetryPolicy` interface required by `withRetryPolicy` is the following:

        ```typescript
        /**
        * Configures how the executor retries failures
        */
        export type RetryPolicy = {
            maxAttempts: number;
            minDelay: Duration;
            maxDelay: Duration;
            multiplier: number;
            maxJitterFactor?: number;
        };
        ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
