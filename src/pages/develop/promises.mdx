# Working with Golem Promises

Golem **promises** provide a way for Golem workers to wait on an external condition. The worker creates the promise and somehow sends its identifier to the external system responsible for **completing** the promise. Then the worker can **await** the promise, being suspended until the external system completes the promise using Golem's REST API.

It is also possible to complete a promise from within a Golem worker using the Golem SDK.

When a promise is completed, an arbitrary byte array can be attached to it as a payload - this data is returned to the awaiting worker when is continues execution.

In TypeScript the promise API has idiomatic TypeScript wrappers in the Golem TypeScript SDK.

### Creating a promise

To create a promise simply call the `createPromise` function:

```typescript
import { createPromise, PromiseId } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

const promiseId: PromiseId = createPromise()
```

The returned value has the type `PromiseId`, and defined as the following (including the nested types):

```typescript
export type OplogIndex = bigint

export interface Uuid {
  highBits: bigint
  lowBits: bigint
}

// Represents a Component
export interface ComponentId {
  uuid: Uuid
}

// Represents a Worker
export interface WorkerId {
  componentId: ComponentId
  workerName: string
}

// A promise ID is a value that can be passed to an external Golem API to complete that promise
// from an arbitrary external source, while Golem workers can await for this completion.
export interface PromiseId {
  workerId: WorkerId
  oplogIdx: OplogIndex
}
```

### Deleting a promise

If a promise is no longer used, it has to be deleted with:

```typescript
import { deletePromise, PromiseId } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

deletePromise(promiseId)
```

### Awaiting a promise

To await a promise, use the `awaitPromise` functions, which returns the promise result as a byte array payload.
Here's an example that awaits a promise, then decodes the payload from JSON format:

```typescript
import { awaitPromise, PromiseId } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

const byteArrayPayload: Uint8Array = awaitPromise(promiseId)
const payload = JSON.parse(new TextDecoder().decode(byteArrayPayload))
```

### Completing a promise from within a worker

To complete a promise from within a worker, use the `completePromise` function.
The following example completes a promise with a value encoded as JSON:

```typescript
import { completePromise, PromiseId } from "@golemcloud/golem-ts"

const payload = {
  id: "value",
  meta: "data",
}
const byteArrayPayload: Uint8Array = new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(payload))
const success: boolean = completePromise(promiseId, byteArrayPayload)
```

### Completing a promise from an external source

To see how to use the **promise ID** to complete a promise through the external REST API, check [the REST API documentation](/rest-api).
