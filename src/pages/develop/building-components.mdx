# Building Golem Components
Building Golem components having an [application manifest](/app-manifest) is straightforward.

Use the `golem` command line interface to run the build:

```shell copy
golem app build
```

The result of the `golem app build` command is a WebAssembly component file ready to be deployed to Golem. To deploy it, use the `deploy` command:

```shell copy
golem app deploy
```
