# Next steps

After [setting up the TypeScript development environment](/develop/setup) and learning the basic steps [writing a Golem component](/develop/defining-components) and [building them](/develop/building-components),
consider learning about the following topics for creating more advanced Golem agents, or proceed to the [Invoke section](/invoke) to learn how to call these agents:

<Steps>

### Making HTTP requests from a Golem component
Learn how to [send HTTP requests from a Golem component written in TypeScript](/develop/http).

### Control durability guarantees

Check how the TypeScript Golem SDK can [control various durability settings](/develop/durability) of Golem.

### Automatic retries

Learn about Golem's retry mechanism and [how it can be customized](/develop/retries).

### Transactions

Use the higher level [transactions library](/develop/transactions) to implement the _Saga pattern_.

### Promises

Create and use [promises](/develop/promises) to await external events from within a running agent.

### Call other agents from an agent

[Agent to Agent communication](/develop/rpc)

### Set up the agent's filesystem

[Agent filesystem](/develop/agent-filesystem)

### Use LLMs

[LLMs](/develop/ai)

### Use fork to achieve parallelism

[Forking agents](/develop/forking)

</Steps>
