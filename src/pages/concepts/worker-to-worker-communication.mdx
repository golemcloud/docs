# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

The WASM component model eliminates the need for microservice architectures,
since components written in different languages can interact with each other
in-process (through component composition), without having to go through
remote protocols like HTTP, gRPC, or JSON RPC.

Despite this, however, there are times when remote procedure calls (RPC) are
useful or necessary when developing applications on Golem:

1. You want to parallelize computation that cannot be done on a single worker,
   either due to lack of memory or lack of compute.
2. You want to partition state that is too large to store in a single worker;
   or, perhaps, you want to partition state that can fit in a single worker, but
   cannot be read and written fast enough due to contention.

Both of these are examples require the development of a distributed system,
where some combination of state and computation is distributed to improve
performance, reduce latency, or improve scalability.

To build a system that distributes state or compute, it is necessary to
coordinate work, which requires RPC of some kind.

Recognizing the critical nature of internal communication for many distributed
systems, Golem provides a feature called _worker-to-worker communication_. This
feature allows you to simply, and in a type-safe way, communicate between
workers, with strong guarantees, such as reliable, exactly-once invocation
semantics.

# Technical details

For worker-to-worker communication, Golem generates a type-safe client interface for each remotely callable component. These client interfaces are matching the component's interface, but packaged into a _resource_ that can be only constructed by giving enough information to know which _worker_ to communicate with.

In case of _durable components_, this can be either a worker name (using the known name of the component) or a custom worker ID for special use cases. For _ephemeral components_, there is no need to specify a worker name, as each call will spawn a new ephemeral worker.

Caller components are importing this generated client interface, so they no longer only use the host interfaces provided by Golem but also this dynamically created one.

There are two ways to resolve this extra import:

- Using the `wasm-rpc` binding type in the [application manifest](/app-manifest). In this case the import will be dynamically linked in the Golem server whenever a worker of the caller component is created. This is the recommended way as it has no additional build-time dependencies.
- Using the `static-wasm-rpc` binding type in the [application manifest](/app-manifest). In this case the build tool (`golem app build`) will generate a Rust implementation of the client interface, compile it to WASM and *compose* it with the caller component's WASM module. This is useful for studying how the client implementation works, but as it requires the Rust toolchain to be installed, it is not recommended in general.
