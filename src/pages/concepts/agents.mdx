# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

In server-based programming, the fundamental unit of work is the _server_, which
accepts incoming connections, and handles requests by generating responses.

In Golem, which is a serverless computing platform, the fundamental unit of
work is the _worker_. A worker is a _running instance_ of a component, with a
unique identity, which allows addressing specific workers.

Workers are similar to _lambdas_ or _functions_ in other serverless computing
platforms, but they are far more powerful and expressive.

<Callout type="info">
  The relationship between a component and a worker is the same as the relationship between an
  executable and a process: processes are running instances of executables. While the executable
  contains mostly code, which awaits execution, a process contains both code, as well as dynamic
  state, which captures work-in-progress.

# Worker Essentials

The fundamental elements of every worker include:

- **Identity**. Every worker has a unique identity, which allows addressing
  specific workers.
- **State**. Every worker has state, including memory, environment variables,
  and file system.
- **API**. Every worker has a public API, defined by its component.

These core elements are discussed in the sections that follow.

## Ephemeral vs Durable Workers

Golem supports two types of workers, **ephemeral** and **durable**. Ephemeral workers are created on the fly for each invocation, and are not suitable for stateful applications. This makes them cheaper and more performant. Durable workers, on the other hand, preserve their state across invocations and provide much stronger guarantees.

Whether a worker is ephemeral or durable depends on the configuration of the deployed **component**. The component type can be changed from ephemeral to durable or the other way around, but this change results in a new _component version_, and will not affect the already running workers.

## Identity

Every worker has a globally unique identity, which is formed from the
following elements:

- **Component ID**. Every component deployed on Golem has a globally
  unique identity (UUID), which is assigned by Golem when a new component
  is uploaded to Golem.
- **Worker Name**. The worker name can be chosen by you for each worker.
  If you do not need to address specific workers, you can also use a UUID for
  the worker name. The only constraint is that worker names must be unique
  within the scope of their component. _Ephemeral workers_ have no user-defined names, their name is always a generated UUID provided by the execution environment.

The unique identity of workers allows them to be addressed individually,
which unlocks many powerful patterns for building distributed systems.

## Durable Worker State

Workers are inherently stateful, in the same way that any running process
is stateful. Workers have the following stateful elements:

- **Memory**. A worker has in-memory state, such as global variables, stack,
  and so on, which constantly changes over the life of the worker.
- **Environment Variables**. A worker has environment variables, which it
  inherits from component settings and any initial settings when the worker is
  created, and which may change over time.
- **File System**. A worker has a file system, which currently starts out
  empty, but which may evolve over the life of the worker.
- **Status**. The status of the worker, managed by Golem, is one of the
  following: running, idle, suspended, interrupted, retrying, failed, or
  exited.

State also includes something called the _instruction pointer_, which is not
accessible in most programming languages, but which tracks which location in the
code the CPU is currently executing.

## API

Workers are running instances of components. Because components have a public
API, which is defined by WIT, workers inherit this API.

To perform work, such as handling a request, you _invoke_ a worker's public API.
This process is referred to as _invocation_, and you can learn more in the
section on [invocation](/concepts/invocations).

# Durable Worker Guarantees

Golem executes workers with strong guarantees. To understand these guarantees,
you should read the section on [reliability](/concepts/reliability).

However, in brief, Golem provides the following guarantees:

- **Transactional Execution**. Workers are executed transactionally. Once a
  worker is started, it will be executed to completion, even in the presence of
  faults, restarts, or updates. It's perfectly acceptable to use workers for
  high-value use cases, such as financial transaction processing; or for
  implementing APIs that coordinate updates across multiple systems.
- **Durable State**. All worker state, including in-memory state, is durable,
  and can be treated as automatically persistent. This means that state
  survives failures, restarts, and updates without the loss of any
  information. Workers may treat their memory as a database, and use it to
  persist state indefinitely and across any number of invocations.
- **Reliable Internal Communication**. Workers can communicate with each other
  using their public APIs, in a type-safe way. Worker-to-worker communication
  is reliable, with exactly-once semantics, and can be used to build
  sophisticated and stateful distributed systems.
- **Resilient External Communication**. Workers can freely communicate with
  external systems, such as databases, message queues, and APIs. External
  communication is automatically resilient, with exactly-once semantics for
  systems that support idempotency keys, and at-least-once semantics for
  systems that do not.
- **Indefinite Life**. Unless forcibly deleted or failed in a way that is
  unrecoverable (e.g. corruption of memory in a C program), workers live
  forever, without loss of state or progress. This allows workers to be used
  for long-running tasks, such as background processing, or for implementing
  APIs that require long-lived state.
- **Secure Sandboxing**. Workers are executed in completely sandboxed
  environments, with no possibility of workers interacting with each other
  (except via their public APIs), and no possibility that one worker's failure
  impacts another worker's health.

Some of these guarantees are common across all serverless platforms, but others
are unique to the durable computing environment that Golem provides.

# Classic Serverless

Although Golem brings the power of durable computing to serverless, it is still
possible to use Golem as a classic serverless platform.

This enables increased reliability and use of serverless for long-running tasks,
financial transactions, and other use cases that are not well-suited to
traditional serverless platforms.

## Comparing Functions to Workers

|               | Worker | Function | Explanation                                                                                                           |
| :------------ | :----: | :------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Low-Latency   |   ✅   |    ✅    | Functions in serverless environments are designed to execute quickly, making them suitable for low-latency use cases. |
| Scalable      |   ✅   |    ✅    | Functions in serverless environments scale automatically, making them suitable for high-throughput use cases.         |
| Stateful      |   ✅   |    ❌    | Workers are inherently stateful, which means they maintain state for their lifetime, and across repeated invocations. |
| Long-Running  |   ✅   |    ❌    | Workers run indefinitely, without loss of state or progress, making them uniquely suitable for long-running tasks.    |
| Transactional |   ✅   |    ❌    | Workers are executed with strong transactional guarantees, transparently surviving faults, restarts, and updates.     |
| Persistent    |   ✅   |    ❌    | All worker state, including in-memory state, is persistent and survives failures, restarts, and updates without loss. |

## Emulating Classic Serverless

Golem's **ephemeral workers** are emulating the classic serverless behavior, with the difference that they can have multiple entry points (exported functions). To fully emulate the classic serverless approach, you only need to do two things:

1. **One-Export Component**. While WASM components can have any number of
   exports, when emulating classic serverless, you should only have one export
   per component. This export represents the event or request handler that you
   would typically have in a classic serverless function.
2. **Define the component as ephemeral**. Choosing the ephemeral component type will make all its workers ephemeral, which means invocations does not have to specify a _worker name_, and for each invocation a new instance of the ephemeral worker will be created.

Golem still persists some information about each ephemeral worker that was created, which can be used for debugging purposes, but this state gets persisted in the background, not affecting the worker's performance.

## Operations

Workers support the following operations:

- **Creation**. Workers benefit from automatic creation, which occurs when a
  worker is invoked for the first time. Therefore, it is not necessary to
  create workers explicitly.
- **Interruption**. Workers can be interrupted at any time, which causes the
  worker to stop executing. Interrupted workers can be resumed later.
- **Deletion**. Workers can be deleted, which causes all state of the worker
  to be permanently deleted. Deleted workers cannot be undeleted or resumed,
  and if invoked again, they will be recreated from scratch.
- **Updating**. Workers can be updated to a newer version of a component, which
  is useful for long-lived workers that can benefit from bug fixes or new
  features.
- **Observation**. The persistent operation log of a worker can be queried and searched, which can be useful in debugging and auditing scenarios.

Details about how to perform these operations can be found in the CLI guide,
the REST API reference, and language-specific SDK documentation.

### Worker Update

When a new version of a **component** is created (by deploying a new version of the component, changing its type or installing plugins to it), the existing workers continue to run using the version they have been created with. Existing workers have to be explicitly updated to a new version if needed.

Newly created workers are created using the latest version of the component. This also means that for **ephemeral workers** each invocation always runs using the latest version of the component.

There are two ways to update an existing worker to a new version of a component, and the update operation (triggered through the REST API, CLI, Console or host interface) can choose from either of them. These are the following:

- **Automatic update**. Golem tries to automatically update the worker to the new version, and may fail to do so.
- **Manual update**. For manual update the component author must provide a pair of save/load functions that are used to migrate the state of the worker from the old version to the new version.

#### Automatic update details

Automatic update can be initiated any time, even while the worker is processing an invocation. The executor interrupts the worker, reloads it using the new component version and then replays the worker's oplog from the beginning of time. If the replay succeeds with the new codebase, the worker continues running from where it was interrupted, but now on the new component version. If the replay fails, the worker gets reverted to the original component version and continues running with that.

How can the replay fail? Golem performs **divergence detection** during replaying the oplog. The following situations are considered divergences:

- **Invocation result divergence**. If the new component produces a different result value for a past invocation than the old one
- **Side effect divergence**. If the new component would perform different side effects (such as HTTP requests, generating random numbers, accessing the current time, etc) than the ones that have been recorded.

Because of these strict requirements, automatic update is only useful when the changed code is minor or it affects code paths that haven't run yet or did not exist at all before.

#### Manual update details

For manual update the old component version must implement the `golem:api/save-snaphot` interface, and the new component version must implement the `golem:api/load-snapshot` interface. The update operation is enqueued the same way as invocations are enqueued, as it can only be performed when the worker is idle. As soon as all the previously enqueued and running invocations are finished, the executor calls the save snapshot function that returns an array of bytes representing the state of the worker. Then the worker gets restarted using the new component version, and the new component's load snapshot functions is called with the saved state. The load snapshot function may return with a failure in which case the worker's component version gets reverted to the original version and it continues running with that. Otherwise if the snapshot was successfully loaded the worker continues running with the new component version.
