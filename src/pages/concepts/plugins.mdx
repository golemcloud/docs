# Introduction

Golem Plugins provide ways to extend the functionality of Golem without having to modify the core codebase. Plugins can be installed to both the open-source and the hosted versions of Golem.

This page introduces the types of plugins Golem supports and explains their lifecycle.

<Callout type="warning">
  Plugin support is experimental and not fully available in Golem 1.1 yet. The next release will
  include stronger guarantees, UI support and better documentation and examples.
</Callout>

## Types of plugins

Golem supports the following types of plugins:

- **Component transformer** plugins can alter an uploaded component when it gets uploaded to Golem
- **Oplog processor** plugins can observe running workers
- **Library plugins** and **application plugins** are special, easier to use versions of component transformer plugins

### Component transformer plugins

Component transformer plugins are external web services providing a HTTP endpoint that receives a WASM component and returns a transformed WASM component. The most common use case for this type of plugin is to use **component composition** to achieve one of the following goals:

- Replace one or more of the host interfaces provided by Golem. For example a component transformer plugin may implement the WASI KeyValue store interface for a component by connecting to a third party database, instead of using the one provided by Golem.
- Wrap the host interfaces provided by Golem. In this case the adapter the plugin composes the uploaded component with both imports and exports the same interfaces, and by that wraps Golem's implementation for example to publish metrics or perform logging.
- Extend the provided interface of the component by exporting additional invokeable functions.

#### Library plugins

Library plugins are special component transformer plugins that does not require any external HTTP services running. A library plugin is a WASM component that is going to be composed with the user's uploaded components in a way that every exported interface of the plugin's WASM is plugged into the user component's matching imports.

#### Application plugins

Application plugins are similar to library plugins with the difference that the user's component's exported interface is getting plugged into the plugin's matching imports.

### Oplog processor plugins

Oplog processor plugins are special **golem workers** implementing the `golem:api@1.1.0/oplog-processor` interface. These plugins are instantiated and by Golem, and got periodically invoked with oplog entries - a journal of operations performed by workers where the plugin is installed.

<Callout type="warning">
  Oplog processor plugin support is experimental. The final version will guarantee **exactly-once**
  semantics for processing the oplog of the workers, which means that if the plugin is installed and
  activated for a worker, we guarantee that the plugin will receive _all of the oplog entries_ of
  that worker (even from before the plugin was acitve), and each entry will be only sent exactly
  once. This guarantee is not implemented yet.
</Callout>

## Plugin configuration

Plugins can have **configuration** in the form of key-value pairs, which are customizable for each **plugin installation**. Golem sends these configuration values to the plugins when they are invoked.

## Plugin lifecycle

Plugins are first **defined** using Golem's Plugin API (using the REST API, CLI or the Console). Each defined plugin is identified by a _name_ and a _version_. In _Golem Cloud_ plugins are defined per account.

Defining a plugin does not immediately make that plugin used by Golem. To make use of a plugin, it must be **installed** to a **component**. This can be done either when a component is created, or later using the Component API. In _Golem Cloud_ plugins can also be installed to _projects_, in which case each new component created in the given project will have those plugins installed.

Installing a plugin to a component creates a new **component version**, similarly how updating a component's WASM file does. This guarantees that already running workers are not affected by the plugin installation process. To make an existing worker use of an installed plugin, the worker must be **updated** to the new component version.

Oplog processor plugins can also be **activated** and **deactivated** on a running worker dynamically using the Worker API. This is an advanced feature which allows the user to temporarily pause an effect of a plugin for a given worker.
