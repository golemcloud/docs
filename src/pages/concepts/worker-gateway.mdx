# Introduction

Golem is a durable computing platform that makes it simple to build and deploy
highly reliable distributed systems.

Golem is highly scalable, and partitions [agents](/concepts/agents) across
many worker executor nodes, which are each in charge of running a different
subset of agents.

Although partitioning agents across many nodes provides the benefit of
horizontal scalability, it makes it more difficult to know which node is
executing a particular agent.

Even if you know which node is executing an agent, it would not be convenient to
interact with the node directly, because it could fail, and you would have to
implement logic that detects failure and waits until the agent is recovered on
a new node before retrying the invocation.

To address these issues, Golem has a _Worker Gateway_ service, which is
effectively stateless and scaled independently of worker executor nodes.

The primary functions of the _Worker Gateway_ are as follows:

1. Identify the node that is responsible for executing the agent being invoked,
   and route the invocation request to the node.
2. Transparently handle executor node failures by detecting failure, awaiting
   recovery, and retrying the invocation.
3. Support the execution of custom APIs, which satisfy arbitrary business and
   technical requirements.

To learn more about how the Worker Gateway supports custom APIs, read the [API definitions](/concepts/api-definitions) page.
