# Building Golem Components in Rust

Building Golem components written in Rust is a single call of the `cargo component build` command:

```shell
$ cargo component build
Generating bindings for example (src/bindings.rs)
 Compiling example v0.1.0 (/Users/golem/tmp/doc-temp/example)
 Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33s
 Creating component target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/example.wasm
```

The `target/wasm32-wasip1/debug/example.wasm` file is a WebAssembly component ready to be uploaded to Golem.

It is recommended to compile a **release build** of the component before deploying it to Golem as it is more optimized and smaller in size:

```shell
$ cargo component build --release
Generating bindings for example (src/bindings.rs)
 Compiling example v0.1.0 (/Users/golem/tmp/doc-temp/example)
 Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.33s
 Creating component target/wasm32-wasip1/release/example.wasm
```

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure the **Creating component ...** line is printed. Some previous versions of `cargo-component` failed silently in some cases, skipping the last part of packaging the built WebAssembly module into a **component**.

It is possible to verify that the result `.wasm` is a valid WebAssembly component by using the `wasm-tools` CLI tool and running:

```shell
$ wasm-tools print target/wasm32-wasip1/release/example.wasm --skeleton
```

The top-level node must be `component` and not `module`.

</Callout>

### IDE support

Any IDE supporting Rust can be used, however for creating the result WASM file, the `cargo component build` command must be used instead of the usual `cargo build` command that the IDE might use under the hood.

When using `rust-analyzer`, read the following section of the `cargo-component` documentation about how to configure it properly: https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component#using-rust-analyzer
