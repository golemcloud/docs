# Golem Host functions

Golem provides three WIT **packages** of host functions for accessing Golem-specific functionality on top of the standard WebAssembly system interfaces.

These three packages are:

- `golem:api@1.1.6` - provides access to various aspects of Golem for the workers
- `golem:rpc@0.2.0` - defines the types and functions serving the [Worker to Worker communication](concepts/worker-to-worker-communication) in Golem
- `golem:durability@1.2.0` - provides an API to implement custom durability in libraries

Please check the **language specific guidelines** to learn the best way to work with these APIs in your language of choice:

This page provides an overview of all the exported functions and types in a language-agnostic way.

### Types

An **oplog index** points to a specific instruction in the worker's history:

```wit
/// An index into the persistent log storing all performed operations of a worker
type oplog-index = u64;
```

The **worker id** uniquely identifies a worker in the Golem system:

```wit
/// Represents a Golem worker
record worker-id {
    component-id: component-id,
    worker-name: string
}
```

Components are identified by a **component id** which is in fact a UUID:

```wit
/// Represents a Golem component
record component-id {
    uuid: uuid,
}

/// UUID
record uuid {
  high-bits: u64,
  low-bits: u64
}
```

Component versions are unsigned integers:

```wit
/// Represents a Golem component's version
type component-version = u64;
```

### Promises

#### Types

A promise is identified by a `promise-id` type consisting of the owner worker's identifier and a number that points to
the create promise function in the worker's history:

```wit
/// A promise ID is a value that can be passed to an external Golem API to complete that promise
/// from an arbitrary external source, while Golem workers can await for this completion.
record promise-id {
    worker-id: worker-id,
    oplog-idx: oplog-index,
}
```

#### Functions

The following functions define the **promise API**:

| Function name      | Definition                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `create-promise`   | `func() -> promise-id`         | Creates a new promise and returns its ID                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `await-promise`    | `func(promise-id) -> list<u8>` | Suspends execution until the given promise gets completed, and returns the payload passed to the promise completion.                                                                                         |
| `complete-promise` | `func(promise-id, list<u8>)`   | Completes the given promise with the given payload. Returns true if the promise was completed, false if the promise was already completed. The payload is passed to the worker that is awaiting the promise. |
| `delete-promise`   | `func(promise-id) -> ()`       | Deletes the given promise.                                                                                                                                                                                   |

### Worker metadata

#### Types

Worker metadata is described by the following WIT types:

```wit
record worker-metadata {
    worker-id: worker-id,
    args: list<string>,
    env: list<tuple<string, string>>,
    status: worker-status,
    component-version: u64,
    retry-count: u64
}

enum worker-status {
    /// The worker is running an invoked function
    running,
    /// The worker is ready to run an invoked function
    idle,
    /// An invocation is active but waiting for something (sleeping, waiting for a promise)
    suspended,
    /// The last invocation was interrupted but will be resumed
    interrupted,
    /// The last invocation failed and a retry was scheduled
    retrying,
    /// The last invocation failed and the worker can no longer be used
    failed,
    /// The worker exited after a successful invocation and can no longer be invoked
    exited,
}
```

#### Functions

The following functions define the **worker metadata API**:

| Function name         | Definition                                   | Description                                                 |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get-worker-metadata` | `func(worker-id) -> option<worker-metadata>` | Returns the metadata of a worker                            |
| `get-self-metadata`   | `func() -> worker-metadata`                  | Returns the metadata of the worker that calls this function |

### Worker enumeration

The **worker enumeration API** allows listing all the workers belonging to a specific **component**. This is a slow operation and should be used for maintenance tasks and not for the core business logic.

Worker enumeration is a **WIT resource**, providing a method that returns a **page** of workers each time it is called:

```wit
resource get-workers {
    constructor(component-id: component-id, filter: option<worker-any-filter>, precise: bool);

    get-next: func() -> option<list<worker-metadata>>;
}
```

Once `get-next` returns `none`, the enumeration is done.

There are two parameters for customizing the worker enumeration:

#### Filters

An optional `filter` parameter can be passed to the worker enumeration, with the following definition:

```wit
record worker-any-filter {
    filters: list<worker-all-filter>
}
```

The `worker-any-filter` matches workers that satisfy any of the listed filters.

```wit
record worker-all-filter {
    filters: list<worker-property-filter>
}
```

A `worker-all-filter` matches workers only that satisfy all of the listed filters.

```wit
variant worker-property-filter {
    name(worker-name-filter),
    status(worker-status-filter),
    version(worker-version-filter),
    created-at(worker-created-at-filter),
    env(worker-env-filter)
}
```

The `worker-name-filter` matches workers by one of their properties, such as the worker name, status, version, creation date or environment variables.

Each of these variants take a filter record holding a **value** and a **comparator**:

```wit
record worker-name-filter {
    comparator: string-filter-comparator,
    value: string
}

record worker-status-filter {
    comparator: filter-comparator,
    value: worker-status
}

record worker-version-filter {
    comparator: filter-comparator,
    value: u64
}

record worker-created-at-filter {
    comparator: filter-comparator,
    value: u64
}

record worker-env-filter {
    name: string,
    comparator: string-filter-comparator,
    value: string
}
```

Where `filter-comparator` and `string-filter-comparator` are defined as:

```wit
enum filter-comparator {
    equal,
    not-equal,
    greater-equal,
    greater,
    less-equal,
    less
}

enum string-filter-comparator {
    equal,
    not-equal,
    like,
    not-like
}
```

#### Precise enumeration

The `precise` flag switches the worker enumeration into a more costly variant which guarantees that every worker metadata returned is the latest one available at the time the result was generated.

When `precise` is set to `false`, the enumeration returns the last _cached_ worker metadata available for each worker, which may be lagging behind the actual state of the workers.

### Transactions and persistence control

Golem's **transaction API** allows customizing the execution engine's durability and transactional behaviors. These are low level functions, which are wrapped by SDKs providing a higher level transaction API for each supported language.

#### Types

Retry policy is defined by the following record:

```wit
/// Configures how the executor retries failures
record retry-policy {
    /// The maximum number of retries before the worker becomes permanently failed
    max-attempts: u32,
    /// The minimum delay between retries (applied to the first retry)
    min-delay: duration,
    /// The maximum delay between retries
    max-delay: duration,
    /// Multiplier applied to the delay on each retry to implement exponential backoff
    multiplier: f64,
    /// The maximum amount of jitter to add to the delay
    max-jitter-factor: option<f64>
}
```

It is possible to switch between **persistence modes**:

```wit
/// Configurable persistence level for workers
variant persistence-level {
    persist-nothing,
    persist-remote-side-effects,
    smart
}
```

#### Functions

The following functions define the **transaction API**:

| Function name                 | Definition                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `get-oplog-index`             | `func() -> oplog-index`                                | Returns the current position in the persistent op log                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `set-oplog-index`             | `func(oplog-idx: oplog-index) -> ()`                   | Makes the current worker travel back in time and continue execution from the given position in the persistent op log.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `oplog-commit`                | `func(replicas: u8) -> ()`                             | Blocks the execution until the oplog has been written to at least the specified number of replicas, or the maximum number of replicas if the requested number is higher.                                                                                                                                |
| `mark-begin-operation`        | `func() -> oplog-index`                                | Marks the beginning of an atomic operation. In case of a failure within the region selected by `mark-begin-operation` and `mark-end-operation`, the whole region will be reexecuted on retry. The end of the region is when `mark-end-operation` is called with the returned oplog-index.               |
| `mark-end-operation`          | `func(begin: oplog-index) -> ()`                       | Commits this atomic operation. After `mark-end-operation` is called for a given index, further calls with the same parameter will do nothing.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `get-retry-policy`            | `func() -> retry-policy`                               | Gets the current retry policy associated with the worker                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `set-retry-policy`            | `func(policy: retry-policy) -> ()`                     | Overrides the current retry policy associated with the worker. Following this call, `get-retry-policy` will return the new retry policy.                                                                                                                                                                |
| `get-oplog-persistence-level` | ` func() -> persistence-level`                         | Gets the worker's current persistence level.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `set-oplog-persistence-level` | `func(new-persistence-level: persistence-level) -> ()` | Sets the worker's current persistence level. This can increase the performance of execution in cases where durable execution is not required.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `get-idempotence-mode`        | `func() -> bool`                                       | Gets the worker's current idempotence mode.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `set-idempotence-mode`        | `func(idempotent: bool) -> ()`                         | Sets the current idempotence mode. The default is true. True means side-effects are treated idempotent and Golem guarantees at-least-once semantics. In case of false the executor provides at-most-once semantics, failing the worker in case it is not known if the side effect was already executed. |
| `generate-idempotency-key`    | `func() -> uuid`                                       | Generates a new idempotency key.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

### Update

The **update API** enables workers to trigger automatic or manual update of other workers.

#### Types

Automatic and manual updates are distinguished by the following enum:

```wit
/// Describes how to update a worker to a different component version
enum update-mode {
    /// Automatic update tries to recover the worker using the new component version
    /// and may fail if there is a divergence.
    automatic,

    /// Manual, snapshot-based update uses a user-defined implementation of the `save-snapshot` interface
    /// to store the worker's state, and a user-defined implementation of the `load-snapshot` interface to
    /// load it into the new version.
    snapshot-based
}
```

#### Functions

The following function defines the **update API**:

| Function name   | Definition                                                                               | Description                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `update-worker` | `func(worker-id: worker-id, target-version: component-version, mode: update-mode) -> ()` | Initiates an update attempt for the given worker. The function returns immediately once the request has been processed, not waiting for the worker to get updated. |

### Oplog search and query

The `oplog` interface in `golem:api` provides functions to search and query the worker's persisted oplog.

The interface defines a big `variant` data type called `oplog-entry`:

```wit
variant oplog-entry {
    /// The initial worker oplog entry
    create(create-parameters),
    /// The worker invoked a host function
    imported-function-invoked(imported-function-invoked-parameters),
    /// The worker has been invoked
    exported-function-invoked(exported-function-invoked-parameters),
    /// The worker has completed an invocation
    exported-function-completed(exported-function-completed-parameters),
    /// Worker suspended
    suspend(datetime),
    /// Worker failed
    error(error-parameters),
    /// Marker entry added when get-oplog-index is called from the worker, to make the jumping behavior
    /// more predictable.
    no-op(datetime),
    /// The worker needs to recover up to the given target oplog index and continue running from
    /// the source oplog index from there
    /// `jump` is an oplog region representing that from the end of that region we want to go back to the start and
    /// ignore all recorded operations in between.
    jump(jump-parameters),
    /// Indicates that the worker has been interrupted at this point.
    /// Only used to recompute the worker's (cached) status, has no effect on execution.
    interrupted(datetime),
    /// Indicates that the worker has been exited using WASI's exit function.
    exited(datetime),
    /// Overrides the worker's retry policy
    change-retry-policy(change-retry-policy-parameters),
    /// Begins an atomic region. All oplog entries after `BeginAtomicRegion` are to be ignored during
    /// recovery except if there is a corresponding `EndAtomicRegion` entry.
    begin-atomic-region(datetime),
    /// Ends an atomic region. All oplog entries between the corresponding `BeginAtomicRegion` and this
    /// entry are to be considered during recovery, and the begin/end markers can be removed during oplog
    /// compaction.
    end-atomic-region(end-atomic-region-parameters),
    /// Begins a remote write operation. Only used when idempotence mode is off. In this case each
    /// remote write must be surrounded by a `BeginRemoteWrite` and `EndRemoteWrite` log pair and
    /// unfinished remote writes cannot be recovered.
    begin-remote-write(datetime),
    /// Marks the end of a remote write operation. Only used when idempotence mode is off.
    end-remote-write(end-remote-write-parameters),
    /// An invocation request arrived while the worker was busy
    pending-worker-invocation(pending-worker-invocation-parameters),
    /// An update request arrived and will be applied as soon the worker restarts
    pending-update(pending-update-parameters),

and two **resources** for querying a worker's oplog.

- the `get-oplog` resource enumerates through **all entries** of the oplog
- the `search-oplog` resource accepts a **search expression** and only returns the matching entries

Both resources, once constructed, provide a `get-next` function that returns a chunk of oplog entries. Repeatedly calling this function goes through the whole data set, and eventually returns `none`.

### Durability

The `golem:durability` package contains an API that can be leveraged by libraries to provide a custom durability implementation for their own API. This is the same interface that Golem uses under the hood to make the WASI interfaces durable. Golem applications are not supposed to use this package directly.

#### Types

The `durable-function-type` is a variant that categorizes a durable function in the following way:

```wit
variant durable-function-type {
    /// The side-effect reads from the worker's local state (for example local file system,
    /// random generator, etc.)
    read-local,
    /// The side-effect writes to the worker's local state (for example local file system)
    write-local,
    /// The side-effect reads from external state (for example a key-value store)
    read-remote,
    /// The side-effect manipulates external state (for example an RPC call)
    write-remote,
    /// The side-effect manipulates external state through multiple invoked functions (for example
    /// a HTTP request where reading the response involves multiple host function calls)
    ///
    /// On the first invocation of the batch, the parameter should be `None` - this triggers
    /// writing a `BeginRemoteWrite` entry in the oplog. Followup invocations should contain
    /// this entry's index as the parameter. In batched remote writes it is the caller's responsibility
    /// to manually write an `EndRemoteWrite` entry (using `end_function`) when the operation is completed.
    write-remote-batched(option<oplog-index>)
}
```

The `durable-execution-state` record provides information about the current execution state, and can be queried using the `current-durable-execution-state` function:

```wit
record durable-execution-state {
  is-live: bool,
  persistence-level: persistence-level,
}
```

Here the `is-live` field indicates whether the executor is currently _replaying_ a worker's previously persisted state or side effects should be executed. The `persistence-level` is a user-configurable setting that can turn off persistence for certain sections of the code.

The `persisted-durable-function-invocation` is a record holding all the information about one persisted durable function. This should be used during _replay_ to simulate the side effect instead of actually running it.

#### Functions

The durability API consists of a couple of low-level functions that must be called in a correct way to make it work.

The logic to be implemented is the following, in pseudocode:

```
observe-function-call("interface", "function")
state = current-durable-execution-state()
if state.is-live {
  result = perform-side-effect(input)
  persist-typed-durable-function-invocation("function", encode(input), encode(result), durable-function-type)
} else {
  // Execute the side effect
  persisted = read-persisted-durable-function-invocation()
  result = decode(persisted.response)
}
```

The `input` and `result` values must be encoded into `value-and-type`, the dynamic value representation from the `golem:rpc` package.

In cases when a durable function's execution interleaves with other calls, the `begin-durable-function` and `end-durable-function` calls can be used to mark the beginning and end of the operation.
