# HTTP requests in Python

Golem implements the [WASI HTTP](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-http) interfaces so any library built on this specification can be used from Golem components to communicate with external services.

The only way to make HTTP requests from Python code currently is to use these WASI HTTP interfaces directly.
