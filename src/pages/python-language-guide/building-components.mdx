# Building Golem Components in Python
Building Golem components having an [application manifest](/app-manifest) is straightforward, just use the `golem` command line interface:

```shell copy
golem app build
```

If the project was created using `golem app new` as recommended, the `golem app build` command will always work as expected.

The result of the `golem app build` command is a WebAssembly component file ready to be uploaded to Golem. It does not have to be specified explicitly, as the `golem` tool will automatically find the correct file when doing for example:

```shell copy
golem component add
```

## Under the hood
Building Golem components written in Python involves two steps:

<Steps>

### Package the Python code into a WASM component

The `componentize` subcommand of the `componentize-py` tool packages the Python code and the Python interpreter into a single WebAssembly component:

```shell
$ componentize-py componentize main -o py_example.wasm
```

<Callout type="info">
  Note that the `componentize-py` tool respects the `VIRTUAL_ENV` environment variable, so make sure
  to activate the virtualenv if there are any Python dependencies used by your component.
</Callout>

### Reducing the size of the component

The output of `compoenntize-py` is large. It is possible to strip some parts of it to reduce the size by about 50% using the `wasm-tools strip` command:

```shell
$ wasm-tools strip -a py_example.wasm -o py_example_stripped.wasm
```

### Generate the Python bindings from the WIT files

The `bindings` subcommand of the `componentize-py` tool generates the module containing the generated bindings:

```shell
$ componentize-py bindings generated_bindings
```

This will generate bindings into the `bindings` directory.
Make sure to not actually use these bindings to **invoke** imported functions, as they don't have any implementation.

</Steps>
