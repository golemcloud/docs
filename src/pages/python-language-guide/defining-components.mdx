# Defining Golem Components in Python

## Creating a project

Using Golem's **command line interface** provides a set of predefined, Golem-specific **examples** to choose from as a starting point.

To see the available examples for Python, run:

```shell
$ golem list-examples --language python
```

<Callout type="info">
  The set of examples provided by Golem CLI is defined in the open-source repository
  [golem-examples](http://github.com/golemcloud/golem-examples).
</Callout>

Then to create a new project based on the default Python example, run:

```shell
$ golem new --language python --package-name 'golem:demo' py-example
```

The command will create a new Golem project in the `py-example` directory, and print short, language-specific instructions on how to build the project.

## Limitations

<Callout type="warning">
Currently all imports must happen initialization-time, so every module used must be listed in the beginning of the main module.

This limitation is being tracked as [issue#23](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/componentize-py/issues/23).

</Callout>

## Specification-first approach

Golem and the `componentize-py` toolchain currently requires defining the component's interface using the **WebAssembly Interface Type (WIT)** format. See [the official documentation of this format](https://component-model.bytecodealliance.org/design/wit.html) for reference.

Each new project generated with `golem` contains a `wit` directory with at least one `.wit` file defining a `world`. This world can contain **exports** (exported functions and interfaces) and these exports will be the compiled Golem component's public API.

To **implement** the specification written in WIT, the Python code must implement some of these abstract classes.

### Exporting top-level functions

WIT allows exporting one or more top-level functions in the `world` section, for example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

world py-example {
    export hello-world: func() -> string;
}
```

To implement this function in Python, the following steps must be taken:

- the module containing the base class to be implemented from the generated bindings needs to be imported
- implement the exported function as a method in Python of a class with the same name as the base class in the bindings

Let's see in code:

```python
# import the binding module - it's name corresponds with the WIT world's name
import py_example

# implement the exported function as a method in Python
class PyExample(py_example.PyExample):
    def hello_world(self) -> str:
        return "Hello World"
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Note that in WIT, identifiers are using the `kebab-case` naming convention, while Python uses the
  `snake_case` convention for methods, and `PascalCase` for class names. The generated bindings map
  between the two automatically.
</Callout>

### Exporting interfaces

WIT supports defining and exporting whole _interfaces_, coupling together multiple functions and possibly custom data types.

Take the following example:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  add: func(value: u64);
  get: func() -> u64;
}

world py-example {
  export api;
}
```

This is equivalent to having the two exported functions directly exported from the `world` section, so the implementation in Python is once again requires to implement the two exported functions as an implementation of an abstract class:

```python
import py_example
from py_example import exports

state: int = 0

class Api(exports.Api):
    def add(self, value: int):
      global state
      state = state + value

    def get(self) -> int:
       global state
       return state
```

<Callout type="info">
  See the **Managing state** section below to learn the recommended way of managing state in Golem
  components, which is required to implement these two functions.
</Callout>

### Exporting resources

The `WIT` format supports defining and exporting **resources** - entities defined by their constructor function and the available methods on them.

Golem supports exporting these resources as part of the worker's API.

The following example modifies the previously seen _counter_ example to define it as a resource, getting the counter's name as a constructor parameter:

```wit
package golem:demo;

interface api {
  resource counter {
    constructor(name: string);
    add: func(value: u64);
    get: func() -> u64;
  }
}

world py-example {
  export api;
}
```

Resources can have multiple instances within a worker. Their constructor returns a _handle_ which is then used to call the methods on the resource. Learn more about how resources can be implicitly created and invoked through Golem's APIs in the [Invocations page](/concepts/invocations).

To implement the above defined WIT resource in Python a few new steps must be taken:

- the exported interface and the resource itself has two separate abstract classes generated within the `bindings` module, both need to be imported and implemented
- the `Counter` class that implements the resource must have a constructor getting the `name` parameter
- the implementations module structure must reflect the generated binding's module structure. In this case, the `Counter` implementation must be placed in a module named `api`.

Let's see in code:

```python filename="main.py"
import py_example
from py_example import exports

class Api(exports.Api):
    pass

```

```python filename="api.py"
import py_example
import py_example.exports
from py_example.exports import api

class Counter(api.Counter):
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.state = 0

    def add(self, value: int):
        self.state = self.state + value

    def get(self) -> int:
        return self.state
```

Note that the `Counter` class can encapsulate it's own state, as every resource instance will be mapped to a corresponding instance of the Python class.

### Data types defined in WIT

The `WIT` specifications contains some primitive and higher level data types and also allows defining custom data types which can be used as function parameters and return values on the exported functions, interfaces and resources.

The following table shows an example of each `WIT` data type and the corresponding Python type it is mapped to:

## Worker configuration

It is often required to pass _configuration values_ to workers when they are started.

In general Golem supports three different ways of doing this:

1. Defining a list of string arguments passed to the worker, available as **command line arguments**
2. Defining a list of key-value pairs passed to the worker, available as **environment variables**.
3. Using **resource constructors** to pass configuration values to the worker.

### Command line arguments

The command line arguments associated with the Golem worker can be accessed by reading the standard Python `sys.argv` variable:

```python
import sys
print(sys.argv)
```

Command line arguments can only be specified when a worker is **explicitly created** and they are are empty by default, including in cases when the worker was implicitly created by an [invocation](/concepts/invocations).

### Environment variables

Environment variables can be accessed in Python using the standard `os.environ` map:

```python
import os
print(os.environ['KEY'])
```

Environment variables can be specified when a worker is **explicitly created**, but there are some environment variables that are always set by Golem:

- `GOLEM_WORKER_NAME` - the name of the worker
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_ID` - the ID of the worker's component
- `GOLEM_COMPONENT_VERSION` - the version of the component used for this worker

In addition to these, when using [Worker to Worker communication](/python-language-guide/rpc), workers created by remote calls **inherit the environment variables of the caller**.

This feature makes environment variables a good fit for passing configuration such as hostnames, ports, or access tokens to trees of workers.

### Resource constructors

As explained earlier, Golem workers can export **resources** and these resources can have **constructor parameters**.

Although resources can be used in many ways, one pattern for Golem is only create a single instance of the exported resource in each worker, and use it to pass configuration values to the worker. This is supported by Golem's worker invocation syntax directly, allowing to implicitly create workers and the corresponding resource by a single invocation as described on the [Invocations page](/concepts/invocations).

## Managing state

Golem workers are **stateful**. There are two major techniques to store and manipulate state in a Golem worker implemented in Python:

1. Using global variables
2. Using **resources** and storing state in the resource's class

Both techniques has been demonstrated in the code examples above.
