## Setup development environment for Python

Python programs can be compiled into WASM components using the tool `componentize-py`. For **Golem** you should use our forked version of this tool, as it pins all its dependencies to the one required by Golem Cloud.

First install Python 3 to your system and once you have access to the `pip` package manager, install `componentize-py` using:

```shell
$ pip install componentize-py==0.16.0

$ componentize-py --version
componentize-py 0.16.0
```
