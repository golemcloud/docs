# Shared WIT packages

When having multiple components in an application, we often want to share some of the WIT types between them. The application template used by `golem app new` contains a predefined way to add these shared packages.

<Steps>
    ### Create a new package

    The application's root directory has a `wit` directory, initially only containing an empty `common.wit` file. This file is just there to satisfy the requirements of some build tools, such as `wit-bindgen`. It should not be modified.

    Instead, create a new package in a subdirectory of `wit/deps`, for example `wit/deps/shared/shared.wit`. Each subdirectory of `wit/deps` must contain one particular package, but these packages can consist of multiple WIT files.

    For example the `shared.wit` file can define an interface with a few data types:

    ```wit
    package myapp:shared;

    interface types {
        type name = string;
        record user {
            id: u64;
            name: name;
        }
    }
    ```

    ### Importing the shared package
    To import this shared package into one or more of the component's WIT files, just add an `import` statement to the component's _world_ like in the following example:

    ```wit
    package myapp:component1;

    // ...

    world component1 {
        import myapp:shared/types;

        // ...
    }
    ```

    and use the `use` statement to import members of the shared interface into another one:

    ```wit
    interface api {
        use myapp:shared/types.{name, user};

        // ...
    }
    ```

    There is no other steps required - `golem app build` will automatically find the shared package and wire everything together as expected.

    ### Sharing code between components depending on shared WIT packages
    The application templates contain predefined "shared" libraries for most supported languages which can be used to shared code between components.

    These are located in the `common-*` directories, where `*` is the language. For example, the `common-rust` directory contains additional Rust crate that can be added as dependencies to the component implementations.

    When using **shared WIT packages** like above, it makes sense to write **shared code** depending on the bindings generated from these shared WIT packages. For example, there could be a JSON codec implemented for the above defined `user` record type which we want to use in multiple components.

    Doing so requires setting up a custom _binding generation_ step, which depends on the language being used:

    <Tabs items={["Rust"]}>
      <Tabs.Tab>
      First add the `wit-bindgen` crate as a dependency to your shared crate under the `common-rust` directory:

      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      wit-bindgen = "0.37.0"
      ```

      Then use the binding generator macro pointing to the **shared WIT package**, for example:

      ```rust
      use wit_bindgen::generate;

      generate!({
          path: "../../wit",
          inline: r#"
          package common:inline;

          world common {
              import myapp:shared/types;
          }
          "#,
          // additional_derives: [serde::Deserialize, serde::Serialize],
          generate_all,
          generate_unused_types: true
      });

      use crate::myapp::shared::types::*;
      ```
      </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
</Steps>
