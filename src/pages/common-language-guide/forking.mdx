# Forking Workers

## Explanation

Golem workers are single threaded. To achieve parallel execution, it is possible to spawn _child workers_ and communicate with them using RPC, as described on the [Worker to Worker communication page](/common-language-guide/rpc).

A simpler way is to use the **fork API**. The fork API consists of a single host function, defined as the following:

```wit
/// Indicates which worker the code is running on after `fork`
enum fork-result {
    /// The original worker that called `fork`
    original,
    /// The new worker
    forked
}

/// Forks the current worker at the current execution point. The new worker gets the `new-name` worker name,
/// and this worker continues running as well. The return value is going to be different in this worker and
/// the forked worker.
fork: func(new-name: string) -> fork-result;
```

When called, a new _worker_ is created using the given name, with exactly the same state as the one that called the `fork` function. The execution continues in both the original and the new workers, with a different `fork-result` result value in each.

## Usage

Using this `fork` function from a component that was created from Golem's built-in templates is straightforward because access to the Golem specific host functions is already set up.

The following code snippet demonstrates calling `fork` and continuing on two different parallel branches based on its result value:
