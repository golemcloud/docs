# Deploy using Docker

To get started we recommend using the Docker Compose file from the [Golem Docker examples](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/tree/main/docker-examples). You will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed on your system.

Once you have Docker Compose installed, you can make use of docker-compose file in Golem repository to spin up Golem.

```bash filename="Terminal" copy
# Download an example docker-compose file along with .env file that has a few common configurations
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemcloud/golem/main/docker-examples/published-postgres/compose.yaml -O  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golemcloud/golem/main/docker-examples/published-postgres/.env

# Start Golem with backend storage as PostgreSQL and Redis
docker compose -f compose.yaml up
```

You may need to modify it to suit your needs.

### Troubleshooting

- If you are running into any port conflicts you can modify the [.env](https://github.com/golemcloud/golem/blob/main/docker-examples/.env) file that was downloaded as part of the above curl command.
- It has come to our note that, in some cases, the docker compose result in the following error:

```bash
error getting credentials - err: exec: "docker-credential-desktop": executable file not found in $PATH, out: `
```

In this situation, the best possible solution is to rename `credsStore` to `credStore` in the `.docker/config.json` file.

- If you still face issues, try the sqlite version of the docker-compose file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose-sqlite.yaml up
```

### Accessing Golem APIs

[Golem APIs](/rest-api) are exposed on port 9881 by default. Worker [API Gateway](/concepts/worker-gateway) endpoint is exposed under port 9006.
