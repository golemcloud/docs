# Building Golem Components in C

Building Golem components having an [application manifest](/app-manifest) is straightforward, just use the `golem` command line interface:

```shell copy
golem app build
```

If the project was created using `golem app new` as recommended, the `golem app build` command will always work as expected.

The result of the `golem app build` command is a WebAssembly component file ready to be uploaded to Golem. It does not have to be specified explicitly, as the `golem` tool will automatically find the correct file when doing for example:

```shell copy
golem component add
```

## Under the hood
Under the hood, building Golem components written in C involves a few steps.

In details, building the component requires the following steps:

<Steps>
### Generate the C bindings from the WIT files

```shell
$ wit-bindgen c --autodrop-borrows yes ./wit
Generating "example.c"
Generating "example.h"
Generating "example_component_type.o"
```

### Compile the C code

Include all your source files and additionally the generated `.c` and `.o` files and use the `clang` provided as part of the WASM SDK:

```shell
$ $WASI_SDK_PATH/bin/clang --sysroot $WASI_SDK_PATH/share/wasi-sysroot  main.c example.c example_component_type.o -o example.module.wasm
```

### Package it into a WASM component

The resulting `example.module.wasm` is a WebAssembly module, not a component. To be able to use it as a **Golem component**, use `wasm-tools` to package the module as a component:

```shell
$ wasm-tools component new example.module.wasm -o example.wasm --adapt adapters/tier1/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
```

<Callout type="info">
Note that the `adapters/tier1/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm` file is placed in the project's directory when using `golem new` to create the new project.

If needed, it can be manually downloaded from https://github.com/golemcloud/golem-wit/blob/main/adapters/tier1/wasi_snapshot_preview1.wasm
