# Setup development environment for C/C++

To write **Golem components** in C or C++, a couple of common WebAssembly tools need to be installed, as well as the latest version of the **WASM SDK**.

## Install WebAssembly tooling

You will need both `wasm-tools` and `wit-bindgen` to work on C/C++ WebAssembly projects.
Consult the [dedicated page](/installing-webassembly-tooling) for instructions on how to install them.

## Install WASI SDK 25.0

Download and extract [WASI SDK 25.0](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-25) somewhere. In the examples we assume that the `WASI_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set up pointing to the extracted SDK.

The SDK contains a version of `Clang` that can compile to WebAssembly modules, which can be converted into Golem components using the `wit-bindgen` and `wasm-tools` command line tools.
