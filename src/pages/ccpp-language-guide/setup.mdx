# Setup development environment for C/C++

To write **Golem components** in C or C++, a couple of common WebAssembly tools need to be installed, as well as the latest version of the **WASM SDK**.

## Install WebAssembly tooling

First of all, to install `wasm-tools` via `cargo`, you need to install the latest stable version of Rust. The recommended way to do so is using [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/):

<Steps>

### Install Rust

Install rustup

```shell copy
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

Install the latest stable version of Rust

```shell copy
rustup install stable && rustup default stable
```

Add the WASI target

```shell copy
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1
```

### Install `wasm-tools`

```shell copy
cargo install --force --locked  wasm-tools@1.223.0
```

Confirm the installation:

```shell
wasm-tools --version
wasm-tools 1.223.0
```

### Install `wit-bindgen`

```shell copy
cargo install --force --locked wit-bindgen-cli@0.37.0
```

Confirm the installation:

```shell
wit-bindgen --version
wit-bindgen-cli 0.37.0
```

</Steps>

<Callout type="warning">
  Golem requires a **specific version** of `wasm-tools` and `wit-bindgen`. Please make sure the
  correct version is installed with the commands described above.
</Callout>

## Install WASI SDK 25.0

Download and extract [WASI SDK 25.0](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-sdk/releases/tag/wasi-sdk-25) somewhere. In the examples we assume that the `WASI_SDK_PATH` environment variable is set up pointing to the extracted SDK.

The SDK contains a version of `Clang` that can compile to WebAssembly modules, which can be converted into Golem components using the `wit-bindgen` and `wasm-tools` command line tools.
